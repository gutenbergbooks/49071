<p class="hang">Further Account of the Omawhaws—Of their Marriages—Of
Infancy, and the Relationship of Parents and
Children—Their Old Age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Omawhaw nation, numbers of the females are
betrothed in marriage from their infancy; and as polygamy
is extremely common, the individual who weds the eldest
daughter, espouses all the sisters successively, and receives
them into his house when they arrive at a proper age.</p>

<p>During her early youth, the daughter continues under
the controul of her parents, with whom she resides, and
donations are occasionally made to her by the lover, which
are received by the parents, and appropriated to their own
use, if the addresses of the individual are favourably received;
but should an alliance with him, or with his family
not to be desirable, his presents are rejected, and the application
is not renewed.</p>

<p>Between the age of nine and twelve years, the young wife
is occasionally an invited visitant at the lodge of her husband,
in order that she may become familiarized with his
company and his bed. But her permanent residence is
still at the house of her parents, where she continues until
the age of thirteen or fourteen, when the parents give
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
notice to their son-in-law, that their daughter is of sufficient
age to partake of his bed. The husband then receives
his bride without any formality, and leaving his
other wives at home, departs with her upon a journey of a
few days, during which time the marriage is consummated.
On their return, the young wife again dwells in the lodge
of her parents, occasionally {210} visited by her husband,
until a general hunt calls the nation from the village.</p>

<p>During this hunt the husband again takes possession of
his bride, whose parents constantly pitch their lodge near
that of the son-in-law.</p>

<p>The husband, previously to introducing his new wife to
his lodge, endeavours to obtain the consent of his other
wives; for this purpose he speaks kindly to them, states
the necessity of providing them with a helpmate to alleviate
their burthens, and thus succeeds in his wishes.</p>

<p>The new matrimonial alliance is at first productive of no
discord in the family; but at length the decided partiality,
displayed by the husband in favour of his recent acquisition,
engenders much jealousy in the minds of his elder
wives. Quarrels often succeed, which are sometimes terminated
by the natural weapons of the wives, who, after
the liberal use of their voluble tongues, apply for more
strenuous aid to the agency of their teeth and nails, or
to the somewhat more formidable array of tomahawks,
clubs, and missiles.</p>

<p>During combats of this nature, the husband remains
perfectly neutral, sitting with his robe drawn over his
head. Should the wives succeed in expelling the recent
intruder, who takes refuge in the house of her parents,
the husband endeavours to soothe their anger, and to
point out to them the impropriety of their conduct.</p>

<p>A lecture of this description, to women elated with victory,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
is not always received in the same conciliatory disposition
with that which dictated the advice; but sometimes
results in another quarrel, which is terminated by the administration
of a few blows on the persons of his refractory
squaws. These will then depart from his lodge, declaring
their determination to live with him no longer; a resolution
which, however, fails with their anger, and they seek
a reconciliation. Their friends apply to the husband in
{211} their favour, and are informed that he was angry
when he flogged them, and that he is now sorry for it.
Thus matters are with but little difficulty adjusted; the
wives return home, and are harangued by the husband,
after which they proceed harmoniously together in their
domestic employments, until some new feud arises to disturb
the repose of the family.</p>

<p>On the general hunting expeditions, in which the nation
separates into distinct bands, the husband takes with him
his favourite wife, whilst the others accompany the bands
in which are their parents. Sometimes, during a temporary
encampment, the husband leaves his favourite for a
few days, on pretence of business, in order to visit one of
his wives in another band. On his return, he perceives
the brow of his favourite to lower with evident displeasure;
if his dog approaches her, she knocks him over with a
club, and her child is repulsed with violence from her
side; she kicks the fire about, pulls about the bed, and exhibits
other signs of anger. The husband affects not to
notice her inquietude, but suffers her to proceed in her own
way, until the violence of her anger appears to be in some
measure dissipated; he will then, perhaps, venture to
request her to repair his mockasins for the morrow's hunt.
"Take them to your dear wife in the other band," will
most probably be the reply to his solicitation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>Such is sometimes the violence of the displeasure of his
squaw, that he is obliged, through prudential motives, to
take refuge in a neighbouring lodge, where he solaces himself
with the pipe, until he supposes there is no longer
danger of being provoked beyond endurance, so as to be
tempted to chastise her; a discipline which she seems rather
to solicit than avoid, that she may have a sufficient excuse
for wreaking her vengeance on her rival, and for giving
free vent to her sentiments and opinions upon her husband,
in language of the most superlatively indecent and
opprobrious nature.</p>

<p>{212} When he retires to repose, he invites her to his bed,
but receives a positive refusal: she rolls herself in her covering
alone; but generally, during the night, she becomes
pacific, and a negociation ensues, which restores harmony
between them.</p>

<p>The far greater portion of their matrimonial quarrels
arise from jealousy, though many affect to treat this
passion with ridicule, or with indifference.</p>

<p>"Were you ever jealous?" said Sans Oreille,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> an Oto
chief, to Mr. Dougherty; "I was once fool enough to be
jealous, but the passion did not long torment me; I recollected
that women are often alone, their husband being
necessarily often absent a hunting, and even when the
husband is at home, the squaw is under the necessity of
going to a distance for the purpose of bringing water, or
collecting wood, when frequent opportunities occur of
being unobserved in the company of other men; and I am
not so silly as to believe that a woman would reject a
timely offer. Even this squaw of mine, who sits by my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
side, would, I have no doubt, kindly accede to the opportune
solicitations of a young, handsome, and brave suitor."
His squaw laughed heartily, but did not affect to repel the
imputation.</p>

<p>Many husbands will take no cognizance whatever of the
breach of conjugal fidelity on the part of the wife; and the
offer of one of their wives for company during the night,
though it might call upon our politeness for a return of
thanks, was no cause of surprise to us during our stay at
their villages.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>A husband of a different temperament of mind, on detecting
his wife in an adulterous act, will rarely endeavour
to maim her paramour, or otherwise seriously injure him
by killing his horses or dogs; but {213} his attention will be
chiefly or exclusively directed to his wife, whom he punishes
by cutting off her hair, rarely her ears or nose; sometimes
he resorts to a different punishment, and scarifies
her face and head with his knife, after which she is repudiated,
and becomes a common prostitute.</p>

<p>An inexorable man, thus circumstanced, has been known
to abandon his frail partner, after subjecting her to a punishment
very similar to that inflicted on the incontinent
Roman matron, under the authority of the Emperors.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>Mr. Dougherty, being in Ong-pa-ton-ga's lodge, heard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
the loud voice of supplication from an unhappy father,
whose daughter had been recently taken in adultery by
her husband. "O, great Ong-pa-ton-ga!" said he, "whose
nose is like that of a mule, and who art greater than the
Wahconda himself, condescend to intercede for my
daughter with her cruel husband; do not permit her
face to be disfigured, her nose to be cut off, or the disgrace
of the punishment of the prairie to be inflicted
upon her."</p>

<p>A <i>brave</i>, who detected his wife in the commission of
adultery, offered her no indignity, but immediately transferred
her to the object of her preference, and accompanied
the gift with a horse, and sundry articles of merchandize.</p>

<p>Even a very remote degree of consanguinity is an insuperable
barrier to the marriage union. This state on
the part of the man, seems to be the result of love for the
woman; on that of the squaw, of convenience, or acquiescence
in the will of her parents. On some occasions,
however, an Indian marries through ambitious motives;
he is, for instance, aspiring to the acquisition of a particular
dignity; he will then endeavour to quiet the opposition
of some powerful individual, by intermarrying in his
family.</p>

<p>Their connubial attachments are often very strong. {214}
An Omawhaw and his squaw, on a solitary hunting expedition,
were discovered at a distance from their temporary
lodge, by a Sioux war-party. They endeavoured to escape
from the enemy, but the squaw was soon overtaken,
struck to the ground, and subjected to the terrible operation
of scalping. The husband, although at this time beyond
the reach of the balls and arrows of the Sioux, seeing
his squaw in their hands, immediately turned upon them,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
and drawing his knife, the only weapon he had, furiously
rushed amongst them, in order to revenge the death of
his squaw, even with the inevitable sacrifice of his own
life; but he was almost immediately despatched, without
having accomplished his heroic purpose.</p>

<p>In the young squaw, the catamenia, and consequent
capability for child-bearing, we were informed, takes place
about the twelfth or thirteenth year, and the capacity to
bear children seems to cease about the fortieth year; but
as superstitious notions prevent these Indians from taking
any note of their ages, these periods are stated with some
hesitation.</p>

<p>When the married squaw perceives that the catamenia
does not recur at the expected period, she attaches a small
leathern string to her girdle, and ties a knot in it, to note
the incipient state of pregnancy, and another knot is added
at termination of each successive moon, as a register of its
progress.</p>

<p>When the squaw perceives the approach of this depurating
process, she retires from her family, and erects a
little shelter of bark or grass, supported by sticks, properly
arranged, where she makes a fire, and cooks her victuals
alone. She is thus compelled by custom to absent herself
until the expiration of four days, when she returns to
her lodge. During this time she must not approach or
touch a horse, as the {215} Indians believe that such contamination
would impoverish that animal. They sometimes
retire, and build their little shelter under a false pretext,
when the real object is to favour the approach of
some esteemed lover, to whom the vigilance of the husband
has denied any other means of obtaining a stolen interview.</p>

<p>The squaw has no need of propitiating the goddess
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
Manageneta,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> but during pregnancy continues her usual
avocations, and even in its most advanced stage, she neither
bears a lighter burden on her back, nor walks a shorter
distance in a day, than she otherwise would; neither does
she expose herself the less on that account to the inclemencies
of the weather.</p>

<p>If, on a march, a pregnant woman feels the pains of parturition,
she retires to the bushes, throws the burden from
her back, and, without any aid, brings her infant into the
world. After washing in water, if at hand, or in melted
snow, both herself and the infant, she immediately replaces
the burden upon her back, weighing, perhaps, between
sixty and an hundred pounds, secures her child
upon the top of it, protected from the cold by an envelop
of bison robe, and then hurries on to overtake her companions.</p>

<p>It is only at the delivery of the first child that any difficulty
is ever anticipated; and, on this occasion, as there are
no professed midwives, the young wife calls in some
friendly matron to assist in case of need. The aid which
these temporary midwives afford, seems to be limited to
the practice of tying a belt firmly about the waist of the
patient, and shaking her, generally in a vertical direction,
with considerable violence. In order to facilitate the
birth, a vegetable decoction is sometimes administered;
and the rattle of the rattle-snake is also given with, it is
said, considerable effect. The singular appendages of
this animal are bruised by pounding, or comminuted by
{216} friction between the hands, mixed with warm water;
and about the quantity of two segments constitutes a dose.</p>

<p>The art of <i>turning</i> does not appear to be known, neither
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
is blood-letting practised in their obstetrics. We heard of
no case of retention of the placenta after parturition,
nor of the affection of longing, or of nausea of the stomach
during pregnancy.</p>

<p>On the delivery of her first child, the young mother,
who appears to be but little enfeebled by the process, arises
almost immediately, and attends to the ordinary housework;
but she does not, in general, undergo any laborious
occupation, such as cutting and carrying wood, until the
lapse of two or three days. The second child is brought
forth without difficulty, and the parent, after bathing, ties
it to a board, after their usual manner, then proceeds with
her daily work, as if nothing extraordinary had occurred.</p>

<p>Mammary abscess is very rare; a squaw of the Sioux
nation died with this complaint.</p>

<p>Sterility, although it does occur, is not frequent, and
seems to be mostly attributable to the husband, as is
evinced by subsequent marriages of the squaws.</p>

<p>The usual number of children may be stated at from
four to six in a family, but in some families are ten or
twelve. Of these the mother has often two at the breast
simultaneously, of which one may be three years of age.
At this age, however, and sometimes rather earlier, the
child is weaned by the aid of ridicule, in which the parents
are assisted by visitors.</p>

<p>The catalogue of the diseases, of both children and
adults, probably bears a similar proportion to that of the
white people, and is far less extensive and appalling.
The summer complaint, so destructive to children in our
region, appears to be uncommon with the Omawhaw
infants; but, during their first year, they suffer more from
constipation of the bowels {217} than from any other complaint,
but which is occasionally remedied by passing a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
small piece of soap (which is obtained from the traders,)
cut into the proper shape, into the rectum.</p>

<p>Dentition seems to be productive of no great distress;
the gums are never cut, but the teeth are permitted to
force their way through. The shedding of the teeth is
also accomplished without much difficulty; the milk-teeth,
being forced out by the permanent ones, either fall from
the mouth, or are gently extracted by the fingers of the
parent.</p>

<p>Monstrous births sometimes occur, though rarely; and
it is not known that infants are ever destroyed by their
parents in consequence of deformity, unless the degree of
malformation is excessive. The Indians mention two
monsters which were born in their village; one of these
they represent as resembling a white bear, and the other
a cray-fish; they were both destroyed. The husband of
the squaw, who gave birth to the former, said that she
must have had connection with a white bear; but she
asserted that the production of the monster was occasioned
by a fright, which she received at seeing her husband suddenly,
whilst he was personating that animal both in dress
and gesture.</p>

<p>The magi affect to converse with the fœtus in utero,
when the mother perceives it to be uneasy; they also
sometimes venture to predict its sex.</p>

<p>Abortion is effected, agreeably to the assertions of the
squaws, by blows with the clenched hand, applied upon the
abdomen, or by repeated and violent pressure upon that
part, or by rolling on the stump of a tree, or other hard
body. The pregnant squaw is induced thus to procure
abortion, in consequence of the jealousy of her husband,
or in order to conceal her illicit amours, to which all the
married squaws, with but few exceptions, are addicted.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>The infant, when recently born, is of a reddish-brown
colour; but in a short time it becomes whitish, {218}
though never so pure a white as that of the children of
white people. The change to the national complexion is
then gradual, and independent of exposure; inasmuch as
those parts of their bodies, which are perpetually concealed
from the light, change simultaneously with the face.</p>

<p>The abdomen of the children protrudes very considerably;
and the sole article of dress, which the younger boys
wear during the warm season, is a small belt of cloth
around the middle of the abdomen, leaving every other
part of the body perfectly naked. In wintry weather they
have the addition of leggings, mockasins, and a small robe.</p>

<p>The female children are furnished with a short piece of
cloth, in imitation of a petticoat, but destitute of a seam,
belted round the loins, and depending as low as the knees.
Their hair, when dressed, is parted longitudinally on the
top of the head, and collected on each side behind the ear,
into a vertical cylindric form, of the length of five or six
inches, decorated with silver and brass rings and ribands;
the line of separation of the hair is coloured with vermilion.</p>

<p>This disposition of the hair into two rolls is generally
observed in the girls, and is often continued one or two
years after their residence with a husband.</p>

<p>The girl is kept in a state of considerable subjection;
she habitually conforms to all the commands of the
mother, and is obliged to assist her in her ordinary occupations;
if she is refractory, she receives a blow upon the
head or back from the hand of the mother, but hardly ever
from the father. At the age of four or five years, she is
taught the use of the <i>hoppas</i>, and is gradually familiarised
to carry burdens. They are trained up to industry,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
and are taught to cut wood, to cultivate maize, to perform
the scalp dance, and are early informed of the sexual relations
of men and women, and warned against the arts
which will be aimed at the subjugation of their virtue.</p>

<p>{219} The experienced parent, however, in addition to
these salutary counsels, keeps a vigilant eye to the deportment
of her unmarried daughter, and so sedulously
guards her steps, that the arts of seduction, notwithstanding
the free use of the licentiousness of language,
appear to be more rarely triumphant over the Omawhaw
maid, than over the civilized fair.</p>

<p>Hence a prostitute, who has never been married, is of
exceedingly rare occurrence. Yet, notwithstanding the
vigilance of the parent, the daughter sometimes elopes
with a favoured lover, but not until she has ascertained
that his intentions are perfectly honourable.</p>

<p>The girl displays the most affectionate regard for her
parents, and grand parents.</p>

<p>Whilst the deportment of the sister is thus trenched and
guarded, the brother roams at large, almost uncontrolled.
Should his conduct be at any time flagrantly outrageous,
he will, perhaps, in the anger of his parents, receive a
harsh reproof; but an ill-judged affection soon prompts
them to assuage his grief, and dry his tears, by presents and
soothing expressions. At a very early age he is furnished
with a bow and arrows, with the use of which he delights
to employ himself, that he may be qualified for a hunter
and warrior.</p>

<p>From the age of about five years to that of ten or twelve,
custom obliges the boy to ascend to a hill-top, or other
elevated position, fasting, that he may cry aloud to the
Wahconda. At the proper season, his mother reminds
him that "the ice is breaking up in the river, the ducks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
and geese are migrating, and it is time for you to prepare
to go in clay." He then rubs his person over with a
whitish clay, and is sent off to the hill-top at sunrise, previously
instructed by his mother what to say, and how to
demean himself in the presence of the Master of life.
From this elevation he cries out to the great Wahconda,
humming a melancholy tune, and calling on him to have
pity on him, and make him a great hunter, {220} horse-stealer,
and warrior. This is repeated once or twice a
week, during the months of March and April.</p>

<p>It is only when his pride is concerned, that the boy is
obedient to the injunctions of his parents; on other occasions
he disregards them, or replies only with ridicule.
A boy in anger discharged an arrow at his mother, which
penetrated her thigh; when, instead of chastising him for
the act, she applauded his spirit, declaring him to be a gallant
fellow, the early promise of a great warrior. But
though he does not scruple thus to insult his parents, he
would unhesitatingly revenge an indignity offered them
by another.</p>

<p>He soon becomes ambitious of martial distinction, in
consequence of frequently hearing the old warriors narrate
their feats of arms, and eagerly anticipates the age
which will justify his enrolling himself in the ranks of a
war-party.</p>

<p>At the age of twelve or thirteen, having received every
instruction respecting their mode of warfare, his wishes
are gratified, and he is accepted as a volunteer in the path
of honour.</p>

<p>As an instance of high chivalric ideas sometimes instilled
into the mind of the Indian, which in some cases
almost supersede the feelings of nature, and which are
eminently calculated to excite a degree of enthusiasm in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
the youthful warrior, the following anecdote may be narrated.</p>

<p>The Osage nation a few years since marched to attack
the Konza village. They encamped unobserved at a
moderate distance from the village, and despatched two
of their warriors with pipes to the Konzas to invite all
their chiefs to a pretended peace conference, and to inform
them that presents of horses and merchandize would be
made to them, to compensate for two individuals of their
nation whom the Osages had killed.</p>

<p>The Konzas, suspecting the treachery intended, {221}
at first proposed to put the messengers to death, but on
further consideration, supposing them sincere, the chiefs
determined to accompany them. On the following morning,
however, when they were about to set out for the
Osage camp, a chief arose and harangued them, stating
that he had had a dream in the night, from the interpretation
of which, he was confident that the Wahconda was
averse to their proposed visit.</p>

<p>This information deterred all from going, with the exception
of two, who mounted their horses and followed
the messenger, saying, that whatever might be the event,
the Osages should not be led to believe that every individual
of the nation was afraid to rely upon their faith.</p>

<p>They were, however, soon undeceived. The enemy,
who had placed themselves in ambuscade on each side of
the path at a suitable position, fired on the Konzas, one
of whom was killed, and the other escaped to his people.</p>

<p>The Osages, who had hoped by this ruse de guerre to
slaughter all the chiefs without any loss to themselves,
finding their scheme abortive, rushed on to attack the
village.</p>

<p>They were met by about one half their number of Konzas,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
who, after an obstinate encounter, repulsed them with
considerable loss.</p>

<p>After the action, some one informed Son-ja-nin-ga that
his son was among the slain. "Did he die with his face
to the enemy?" said the father. "He did so," replied the
other. "Then he perished nobly," rejoined Son-ja-nin-ga,
exultingly, and "I will not lament his fall." This
resolution, however, was so much at variance with his
sensibility, that it could not long be maintained. He
mounted on the top of his lodge, and harangued his people
on the subject of the martial deeds of his son, who had
already become a distinguished warrior; but when he
spoke of his {222} final scene, he was so absolutely overpowered
by grief, that he precipitated himself from his
elevated situation to the earth; receiving, however, but
little injury, he immediately assumed the state of mourning
with its utmost rigours.</p>

<p>At the age of fourteen or fifteen, it is not uncommon for
the young Omawhaw to elope with a married woman, and
fly for protection to the Puncaws.</p>

<p>The home of the young man, until he marries, is his
father's house; but after he thus changes his condition, he
repairs to the house of his father-in-law, until the birth of
the first child, when he returns with his little family to
his father's dwelling, where he continues to reside. On
national hunts he provides a separate skin lodge for his
family.</p>

<p>When more advanced in age, and of some little consequence
or influence amongst the people, he unites with
two or three families in the building of a permanent dirt
lodge in the village, similar to those already described of
the Konzas.</p>

<p>The labour of erecting this edifice devolves almost exclusively
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
upon the squaws. The interior is readily furnished;
the indispensable requisites being only a kettle, a
wooden bowl, and a couple of horn spoons, a few skins for
a bed and covering, a pillow made of leather stuffed with
hair, and a bison's stomach, instead of a bucket, for carrying
water.</p>

<p>On the death of the husband, the squaws exhibit the
sincerity of their grief by giving away to their neighbours
every thing they possess, excepting only a bare sufficiency
of clothing to cover their persons with decency. They go
out from the village, and build for themselves a small
shelter of grass or bark; they mortify themselves by cutting
off their hair, scarifying their skin, and, in their insulated
hut, they lament incessantly. If the deceased has left a
brother, he takes the widow to his lodge after a proper
interval, and considers her as his wife, without any {223}
preparatory formality.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> If the deceased has not left a
brother, the relations of his squaw take her to their lodges.
This lamentation and mortification, which the squaws
impose upon themselves, continue for a period of six or
eight months, or even a year.</p>

<p>Many circumstances tend to show that the squaw is
susceptible of the most tender and permanent attachment
to an individual of the opposite sex, and that on the cessation
of all hope of a union with the beloved object, the consequences
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
have sometimes been fatal. Several instances
came to our knowledge, of a young female committing the
act of suicide after marriage with a person, in obedience
to the will of her parents, whilst her affections were devoted
to another.</p>

<p>The maternal fondness appears also to be not less exquisite
than we perceive it to be with civilized mothers. The
following anecdote may be cited in support of this observation.</p>

<p>In the year 1814, a trader married a beautiful squaw of
one of the most distinguished families in the Omawhaw
nation. This match, on the part of the husband, was induced
by the following circumstances. Being an active,
intelligent, and enterprising man, he had introduced the
American trade to the Missouri Indians, and had gained
great influence amongst them by his bravery and ingenuous
deportment. But he at length perceived that his
influence was gradually declining in consequence of the
presence and wiles of many rival traders, to whom his
enterprise had opened the way, and that his customers
were gradually forsaking him.</p>

<p>{224} Thus circumstanced, in order to regain the ground
he had lost, he determined to seek a matrimonial alliance
with one of the most powerful families of the Omawhaws.
In pursuance of this resolution, he selected a squaw whose
family and friends were such as he desired. He addressed
himself to her parents agreeably to the Indian custom, and
informed them that he loved their daughter, that he was
sorry to see her in the state of poverty common to her
nation, and although he possessed a wife among the white
people, yet he wished to have one also of the Omawhaw
nation. If they would transfer their daughter to him in
marriage, he would obligate himself to treat her kindly;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
and as he had commenced a permanent trading establishment
in their country, he would dwell during a portion of
the year with her, and the remainder with the white people,
as the nature of his occupation required. His establishment
should be her home, and that of her people during
his life, as he never intended to abandon the trade. In
return, he expressed his expectation, that, for this act, the
nation would give him the refusal of their peltries, in order
that he might be enabled to comply with his engagement
to them. He further promised, that if the match proved
fruitful, the children should be made known to the white
people, and would probably be qualified to continue the
trade after his death.</p>

<p>The parents replied with thanks for his liberal offers,
and for his disposition to have pity on them; they would
not object to the connection, and hoped that their daughter
would accept of him as her husband.</p>

<p>The parents then retired, and opened the subject to the
daughter. They assured her that her proposed husband
was a great man, greater than any of the Omawhaws;
that he would do much for her and for them, and concluded
by requesting her to acquiesce in the wishes of the
white man. She replied, that all {225} they said was,
without doubt, true, and that agreeably to his request, she
was willing to become his wife.</p>

<p>The agreement being thus concluded, the trader made
presents, agreeably to the custom of the nation, and conducted
his interesting prize to his house.</p>

<p>The succeeding spring the trader departed for the settlements,
leaving her of course at his trading house.</p>

<p>The ensuing autumn she had the pleasure to see him
return, having now conceived for him the most tender
attachment. Upon his visit the following season, she presented
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
him with a fine daughter, born during his absence,
and whom she had nursed with the fondest attention.
With the infant in her arms, she had daily seated herself
on the bank of the river, and followed the downward
course of the stream, with her eye, to gain the earliest
notice of his approach. Thus time passed on. The second
year the father greeted a son, and obtained his squaw's
reluctant consent to take their daughter with him on his
return voyage to the country of the white people. But
no sooner had he commenced his voyage, and although
she had another charge upon which to lavish her caresses,
than her maternal fondness overpowered her, and she ran
crying and screaming along the river side in pursuit of the
boat, tearing out her long flowing hair, and appearing to
be almost bereft of reason. On her return home she gave
away every thing she possessed, cut off her hair, went into
deep mourning, and remained inconsolable. She would
often say that she well knew that her daughter would be
better treated than she could be at home, but she could not
avoid regarding her own situation to be the same as if the
Wahconda had taken away her offspring for ever.</p>

<p>One day, in company with six other squaws, she was
engaged in her agricultural labours, her infant boy being
secured to his cradle-like board, which she {226} had carefully
reclined against a tree at a short distance. They
were discovered by a war-party of Sioux, who rushed
towards them, with the expectation of gratifying their
vengeance by securing all their scalps. An exclamation
from her companions directed her attention to the common
enemy, and in her fright she fled precipitately, but suddenly
recollecting her child, she swiftly returned full in
the face of the Sioux, snatched her child from the tree,
and turned to save its life, more precious than her own.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
She was closely pursued by one of the enemy, when she
arrived at a fence which separated her from the field of the
trading house. A moment's hesitation here would have
been fatal; and, exerting all her strength, she threw the
child, with its board, as far as she could on the opposite
side.</p>

<p>Four of the squaws were tomahawked, and the others
escaped, of which number the mother was one, having
succeeded in bearing off her child uninjured.</p>

<p>The trader, on his arrival at the settlements, learned
that his white or civilized wife had died during his absence,
and after a short interval devoted to the usual formalities
of mourning, he united his destinies with another,
and highly amiable lady. The second season his wife
accompanied him on his annual voyage up the Missouri,
to his trading house, the abode of his squaw.</p>

<p>Previously to his arrival, however, he dispatched a messenger
to his dependents, at the trading-house, directing
them to prevent his squaw from appearing in the presence
of his wife. She was accordingly sent off to the village of
her nation, a distance of sixty or seventy miles. But she
could not long remain there, and soon returned with her
little boy on her back, and accompanied by some of her
friends, she encamped near her husband's residence.
She sent her son to the trader, who treated him affectionately.
On the succeeding day the trader sent for his
squaw, and {227} after making her some presents, he directed
her to accompany her friends who were then on
their way to their hunting grounds.</p>

<p>She departed without a murmur, as it is not unusual with
the Omawhaws to send off one of their wives, on some
occasions, while they remain with the favourite one.</p>

<p>About two months afterwards the trader recalled her.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
Overjoyed with what she supposed to be her good fortune,
she lost no time in presenting herself before the
husband whom she tenderly loved. But great was her
disappointment, when her husband demanded the surrender
of the child, and renounced for the future any association
with herself, directing her to return to her people,
and to provide for her future wellbeing in any way she
might choose.</p>

<p>Overpowered by her feelings, on this demand and repudiation,
she ran from the house, and finding a periogue
on the river shore, she paddled over to the opposite side
and made her escape into the forest with her child. The
night was cold, and attended with a fall of snow and hail.
Reflecting upon her disconsolate condition, she resolved
to return again in the morning, and with the feelings of a
wife and mother to plead her cause before the arbiter of
her fate, and endeavour to mitigate the cruel sentence.</p>

<p>Agreeably to this determination, she once more approached
him, upon whom she believed she had claims
paramount to those of any other individual. "Here is our
child," said she: "I do not question your fondness for
him, but he is still more dear to me. You say that you
will keep him for yourself, and drive me far from you.
But no, I will remain with him; I can find some hole or
corner into which I may creep, in order to be near him
and sometimes to see him. If you will not give me food,
I will, nevertheless, remain until I starve before your
eyes."</p>

<p>The trader then offered her a considerable present, desiring
her at the same time to go, and leave the {228} child.
But she said, "Is my child a dog, that I should sell him
for merchandize? You cannot drive me away; you may
beat me, it is true, and otherwise abuse me, but I will still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
remain. When you married me, you promised to use me
kindly as long as I should be faithful to you; that I have
been so, no one can deny. Ours was not a marriage contracted
for a season, it was to terminate only with our
lives. I was then a young girl, and might have been united
to an Omawhaw chief; but I am now an old woman, having
had two children, and what Omawhaw will regard
me? Is not my right paramount to that of your other
wife; she had heard of me before you possessed her. It is
true her skin is whiter than mine, but her heart cannot be
more pure towards you, nor her fidelity more rigid. Do
not take the child from my breast, I cannot bear to
<i>hear</i> it cry, and not be present to relieve it;<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> permit me
to retain it until the spring, when it will be able to eat,
and then, if it must be so, take it from my sight, that I
may part with it but once."</p>

<p>Seeing her thus inflexible, the trader informed her that
she might remain there if she pleased, but that the child
should be immediately sent down to the settlements.</p>

<p>The affectionate mother had thus far sustained herself
during the interview with the firmness of conscious virtue,
and successfully resisted the impulse of her feelings; but
nature now yielded, the tears coursed rapidly over her
cheeks, and clasping her hands, and bowing her head, she
burst into an agony of grief, exclaiming, "Why did the
Wahconda hate me so much, as to induce me to put my
child again into your power?"</p>

<p>The feelings of the unhappy mother were, however,
soon relieved. Mr. Dougherty communicated {229} the
circumstances of the case to Major O'Fallon, who immediately
and peremptorily ordered the restoration of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
child to its mother, and informed the trader that any future
attempt to wrest it from her should be at his peril.</p>

<p>As in civilized communities, so amongst the Indians,
quarrels sometimes occur. There being no legal tribunal
to appeal to, amongst the Missouri Indians, individuals
often terminate their animosity by resorting to arms, and
relying upon their own valour or address. This extremity
is, however, sometimes obviated, by the soothing interference
of relatives and friends, or by the violent interposition
of a warrior.</p>

<p>Pugilism they despise, regarding it entirely beneath the
dignity, even of an ordinary man, saying that it is only fit
for the decision of the quarrels of children and squaws,
and that when a man is called upon to decide a question
by force, he ought to resort to the aid of mortal weapons.</p>

<p>Hard heart, chief of the Ioways, quarrelled with a
trader, near the mouth of the Platte, and challenged him
immediately to single combat, with any weapons he might
choose, either agreeably to the manner of the whites, or
to the usual Indian mode, of either combatant availing
himself of opportunity or stratagem. The trader refusing
to fight, Hard heart departed, declaring he would come
again in the morning, in order to put him to death as a
coward; "and," said he, "the Wahconda himself will not
be able to save you." The trader, for security, assembled
around his hut several Oto warriors as a guard, so that
when the chief returned agreeably to his promise, to execute
his threat, he could not gain admittance. After
waiting a long time in vain, he at length sent word to the
trader that he forgave him and would not injure him.
The trader on receiving this information, having sufficient
confidence in his good faith, dismissed his guards; and
some time {230} afterward, we observed them riding together,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
on their return from the Pawnee villages, to which
they had accompanied the Oto nation.</p>

<p>About a twelvemonth before our arrival at Engineer
Cantonment, Hashea (the Cut-nose) and the Brave, two
highly distinguished warriors of the Oto nation, had a very
serious quarrel, which their friends could not perfectly
adjust, but only succeeded in preventing a personal combat.
Since our departure for the Rocky Mountains,
Major O'Fallon informs us, that this hostility, still further
aggravated by another incident, has terminated fatally.
The nephew of the Brave grossly insulted, by his pertinacious
addresses, the wife of Hashea, whilst the latter warrior
was absent on a war excursion. On his return, being
informed of the indignity offered to his wife, he sought
the offender, knocked him down with his war club, and
beat him with great severity. The Brave was summoned
by his friends, who seeing the bruised condition of his relative,
vowed revenge. He provided a large sharp-pointed
knife, and throwing his bison robe over his arm, by way
of shield, he sallied out and passed twice through the village,
uttering occasionally, with a loud voice, a challenge
to Hashea to come forth, and decide their old quarrel by
means of the knife. Hashea feared no man, and would
have presented himself before his old enemy at the first
call, but was prevented by some friends who were with
him in his lodge; these, however, after the lapse of a short
time, he contrived to elude, and swiftly sought the Brave.
He threw down his blanket, and exclaimed, "You and I
cannot live in the same nation; the time has arrived when
one of us must die." They then closed in fight. The
Brave had much the advantage; he was a large man, and
his person was effectually protected by his robe, which received
the thrusts of his adversary's knife, whilst at every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
blow the weapon of the Brave was sheathed in the naked
body of the interesting Hashea. {231} The latter was soon
despatched, but as he staggered backwards under the
grasp of death, he aimed a final blow at his antagonist,
and had the gratification to see his blade enter his neck
and pass far downward; at which he uttered a shout of exultation
and died. The Brave's wound was mortal, but
he lived long enough to see the features of Ietan, the friend
of Hashea, bent in sternness upon him, and to hear him
lament that the conqueror of his friend, should die without
the agency of his arm. The deceased warriors belonged
to the two most powerful bands of the nation.
Hashea was a near kinsman of the Crenier, leader of one
band, and the Brave was a brother of Shongotonga, leader
of the other, and principal chief of the Otos. The consequence
of the quarrel involved the whole nation, and to
avoid farther hostilities the bands separated from each
other, into distinct villages, in which situation they now
remain.</p>

<p>The designations by which the Omawhaws distinguish
their various degrees of consanguinity are somewhat different
in meaning from ours. Children universally address
their father's brother by the title of <i>father</i>, and their mother's
brother by that of <i>uncle</i>; their mother's sister is
called <i>mother</i>, and their father's sister <i>aunt</i>. The same
relative designations extend to the step-parents, relatives,
and to those of the grand-parents. The children of brothers
and sisters address each other by the titles of brother
and sister. Step-parents treat their step-children with as
much kindness and attention as their own; and a stranger
in the family would not perceive any partiality shown to the
latter; indeed the natural parent exacts such a course of
conduct from the other, and a separation would probably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
ensue, from an opposite course being obstinately persevered
in, as a parent will on no account suffer his or her
offspring to be abused.</p>

<p>Natural children are generally retained by the {232}
mother; but if she is willing to part with them, or at her
death, they are received into the family of the father,
where they experience the same kindness and attention as
his other children; but an Indian will consider himself
insulted, if he is told that he had no proper father or
mother.</p>

<p>Some mothers of natural children will not permit them
to visit the father, while she can controul them; they generally
remain with the mother, and support her.</p>

<p>A man applies the title of We-hun-guh, or sister-in-law,
to his wife's sister, until he takes her as his wife; he also
calls his wife's brother's daughter Wehunguh, and may in
like manner take her to wife: thus the aunt and the niece
marry the same man.</p>

<p>A man distinguishes his wife's brother by the title of
Tahong, or brother-in-law, and his son also by the same
designation. He calls the wife of his brother-in-law
Cong-ha, or mother-in-law.</p>

<p>A woman calls her husband's brother Wish-e-a, or
brother-in-law, and speaks of his children as her own.
Her husband's sister she distinguishes by the title of relationship,
Wish-e-cong, or sister-in-law. Men who marry
sisters address each other by the title of brother. All
women who marry the same individual, even though
not previously related, apply to each other the title of
sister.</p>

<p>Remote degrees of consanguineous alliance are distinguished
by their various appellatives, and are universally
acknowledged.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>It is a great singularity in the manners of the Omawhaws
that neither the father-in-law nor mother-in-law will
hold any direct conversation with their son-in-law; nor will
he, on any occasion, or under any consideration, converse
immediately with them, although no ill-will exists between
them; they will not, on any account, mention each other's
name in company, nor look in each other's faces; any conversation
{233} that passes between them is conducted
through the medium of some other person.</p>

<p>The Big Elk, Ongpatonga otherwise named Ar-re-cat-ta-wa-ho,
which means Big Elk in the Pawnee language,
married the daughter of Me-chah-pa, or the Horse-head.
One day, on a visit to his wife, he entered the lodge of her
father unobserved by him, who was busily engaged in
playing with his dog, rubbing him with his hand, and
frequently repeating his name, which unfortunately happened
to be the same with that of the Big Elk in Pawnee.
Mechahpa's wife, hearing her husband repeat this name
in the presence of the son-in-law, after making many
winks and signs without effect, arose from her seat and
struck him violently with her fist upon the back, exclaiming,
"You old fool! have you no eyes to see who is
present? you had better jump upon his neck, (meaning
that of the Big Elk) and ride him about like a
dog." "Wah!" ejaculated Mechahpa, in surprise, at
the sudden and emphatical salutation, and understanding
the meaning of the address, he ran out of the lodge
in confusion.</p>

<p>This extraordinary formality is carried to a great length,
and is very rigidly observed. If a person enters a dwelling
in which his son-in-law is seated, the latter turns his back,
covers his head with his robe, and avails himself of the
first opportunity to leave the presence. If a person visit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
his wife, during her residence at the lodge of her father, the
latter averts himself, and conceals his head with his robe,
and his hospitality is extended circuitously by means of his
daughter, by whom the pipe is transferred to her husband
to smoke. Communications or queries intended for the
son-in-law are addressed aloud to the daughter, who receives
the replies of her husband. The same formality is
observed by the mother-in-law; if she wishes to present
him with food, it is invariably handed to the daughter for
him, or if she happens to be absent for the moment, it is
placed on {234} the ground, and she retires from the
lodge, that he may take it up and eat it. A ten year's
separation will not change this custom. The Pawnees
have no such formality, and on that account are said to
be great fools.</p>

<p>A Frenchman, married and resident with the Omawhaws,
one day inadvertently mentioned the name of his
father-in-law, in presence of several people, who immediately
declared him to be as great a fool as a Pawnee, thus
to have so little respect for his father-in-law, as to treat
him with as little ceremony as he would a dog.</p>

<p>The more distinguished and respectable the parties are,
the more rigidly is this rule observed; and if either of the
parties should be treated otherwise, the departure from
the observance would be regarded as a mark of disrespect
for a trifling fellow.</p>

<p>Fraternal affection is very strong and permanent. The
chief and almost exclusive sources of infraction of this
natural bias, are adultery with each other's wives, and
conflicting intrigues for the attainment of the honour of a
chieftain.</p>

<p>Two Omawhaw brothers had stolen a squaw from an
individual of their nation, and were on their journey to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
seek a refuge in the Puncaw village. But they had the
misfortune, in a large prairie, to meet with a war-party of
Sioux, their implacable enemies. They immediately concealed
themselves in a deep ravine, which at bottom was
covered with dry reed grass. The Sioux surrounded this
spot, and set fire to the windward side of the reeds, in
order to drive them out. When the conflagration had
nearly reached the fugitives, one of the brothers remarked,
that the Wahconda had certainly not created him to be
smoked out like a racoon; (the Indians smoke this animal
out of hollow trees by kindling a fire at the root;) he urged
his brother to attempt his escape in one direction, whilst
he would attract the attention of the enemy, by sallying
out upon them alone, and {235} endeavouring to destroy
as many of them as possible, in anticipated revenge for
that death which he considered as inevitable; "One or both
of us," said he, "must certainly be sacrificed; save yourself
if you can; I will be the victim, and may fortunately receive
a death-blow in the conflict, and thus escape the disgrace
of captivity." He then rushed forth amongst the
Sioux, shot one, and with his knife wounded several before
he was dispatched. His brother availing himself of
the abstracted attention of the enemy, effected his escape,
but the squaw was burned to death. In this magnanimous
self-devotion, the gallant brother exhibits an instance
of chivalric heroism which would have immortalized a
Roman warrior.</p>

<p>The young men are generally coupled out as friends;
this tie is very strongly knit in youth, but is usually enfeebled
by matrimony or the concerns of more advanced
age; yet it is sometimes as lasting as the life of the individuals.</p>

<p>The Omawhaws, as we before observed, preserve no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
account of their ages; they think that some evil will attend
the numbering of their years. Me-chah-pa the Horse-head,
who is an intelligent medicine man, asked one of
our party, whom he was informed was an eminent medicine
man of the white people, amongst many other questions,
how old he was; he was answered, about forty-five,
at which he expressed his regret that he had lived so long
in the world, and to so little purpose.</p>

<p>Old age amongst the Omawhaws is generally loquacious,
but it does not seem to be distinguished, as in civilized life,
by an accumulation of maladies. Aged Indians, whether
male or female, generally continue in apparent good
health to the last, and the visitation of death is most frequently
sudden and unexpected; an instance of this has
already been related, which occurred to old Loutre, an
individual of the Missouri nation.</p>

<p>{236} They become bowed and very much wrinkled with
age, and their joints become less flexible. But their hair does
not so generally change to gray as that of men in a state of
civilization. The hair of the sides of the head, which is
so frequently shorn or extracted, often assumes the gray
appearance at a comparatively early age, and is almost
universally of that tint in aged persons; whilst that of the
top and back of the head, which is always permitted to
attain a moderate length, is simply interspersed with a
few grey hairs. Many aged squaws preserve the hair of
the usual youthful colour; in others we observe an
intermixture of gray, and it may be remarked that the
aged of this sex are more frequently gray-haired than the
men.</p>

<p>We saw a middle aged woman whose hair had pretty
generally changed to gray; but this appearance at her age
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
was so unusual, that the Indians attributed it to her having
infracted the injunctions of her medicine by eating forbidden
food.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>In proportion as persons of either sex approach to the
state of superannuation, the respect of their family and
acquaintances is withdrawn from them, and they are finally
regarded as useless burdens upon the community. They
are subjected to the pranks and ridicule of the young people,
which, however, they seem rather to invite by drollery,
jokes, and stories, than to discourage by a repulsive demeanour.</p>

<p>The aged men contrive to render themselves useful by
assisting the squaws in their culinary operations, and by
haranguing; a service for which their loquacity eminently
qualifies them.</p>

<p>The aged squaws can generally assist in light employments,
such as making and mending mockasins, leggings,
stringing beads, &amp;c.; but during the rigours of winter they
are generally seated near the door of the travelling lodge,
partially defended from the cold by an old ragged robe,
and occupied with {237} the menial service of pushing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
up the half-burned pieces of wood to the fire, and driving
out the dogs; in this situation they are more exposed to the
weather than any other inmate of the tenement.</p>

<p>Though thus neglected, the aged are not permitted to
suffer from hunger, when in the village, if food can be obtained.
But when they become helpless on a march, and
the transporting of them is attended with much difficulty,
it is considered unavoidable to abandon them to their fate;
with this view a small grass shelter is erected for them, in
which some food is deposited, together with wood and
water. When thus abandoned by all that is dear to them,
their fortitude does not forsake them, and the inflexible
passive courage of the Indian sustains them against despondency.
They regard themselves as entirely useless,
and as the custom of the nation has long led them to anticipate
this mode of death, they attempt not to remonstrate
against the measure, which is, in fact, frequently the consequence
of their earnest solicitation.</p>

<p>In this situation the devoted man sings his war-songs to
the Wahconda, narrating the martial exploits of his youth,
and finally chaunts his death-song.</p>

<p>If on the return of the nation from the hunt, he is still
living, his family or friends take him with them to the village,
and guard him from want until the succeeding general
expedition.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II_XII">{238} CHAPTER II {XII}</h2>

<p class="hang">Diseases—Medical and Surgical Knowledge—Drunkenness,
and other Vices—Ideas of God, and of a Future
State—Superstition, and Practice of the Magi—Expiatory
Tortures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Omawhaws endure sickness and pain with great
fortitude; most of them, when thus afflicted, rarely uttering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
a murmur. Their catalogue of diseases, and morbid
affections, is infinitely less extensive than that of civilized
men.</p>

<p>Rheumatism is rare, and gout appears to be unknown.
No case of phthisis or jaundice fell under our observation.
King's-evil is not uncommon, and although they have no
reliance on the sanative touch of a king or chief, yet, as
their practice seems confined to an inefficacious ablution
with common water, many fall victims to the disease.
Many are also afflicted with ulcers, which sometimes terminate
fatally. Decayed teeth are rare. Plica polonica
is unknown. Baldness seems to be also unknown, the
hair being always retained, however advanced the age of
the individual.</p>

<p>Nymphomania occurred in the person of a widow, who
was thus afflicted about two months; her symptoms were
attended with an effusion of blood from the nose. On her
recovery, she attributed the disorder to the operation of
some potent mystic medicine.</p>

<p>Hypochondriasis seems to be unknown. Canine madness
also appears to be without an example, their dogs not
having yet been visited by the disease. [239] They are
rarely afflicted with dysentery, though children are sometimes
subject to it in consequence of eating unripe fruits,
such as plums, grapes, and maize. They are never known
to be subject to the <i>coup de soleil</i>,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> although they travel for
days and even weeks over the unsheltered prairies, without
any covering whatever for the head, which is consequently
exposed to the full radiance of the sun, both in a
state of activity and quiescence. White men residing with
them, and who have partaken in their hunts, and consequent
insolation, have been visited with this distressing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
affection, although their heads were protected invariably
by hats or handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>The cuticle of these Indians is not known to have been
acted upon by contact with poisonous plants, though
white men travelling with them have experienced the
effects of the usual deleterious properties of the poison
vine (rhus radicans,) which is, to a certainty, abundant in
proper situations in the Missouri country. What effects
would result from the application of this plant to the only
part of the body of the Indian which is never exposed to
the direct influence of external causes, is a subject deserving
of experimental inquiry.</p>

<p>The hare-lip sometimes occurs, but it may be properly
considered as still more rare than amongst white people.</p>

<p>Frosted limbs are treated by immersion in cold water,
so as gradually to restore the lost temperature of the part.
The magi also perform over them their mystic rites,
amongst which the only topical application is made by
chewing some roots and blowing the fragments, and accompanying
saliva violently upon the part, with many
antic capers.</p>

<p>Goiture and wens are not known. Fevers, and fever
and ague, are exceedingly rare. Ophthalmic diseases,
and casualties affecting the eye, are frequent. The eyes
of children are sometimes injured or destroyed by missiles,
in incautious play or juvenile {240} rencontres. But blindness
is more frequently the effect of the gradual operation
of disease. The eyes become sore and the lids inflamed;
white opake macul&aelig;, after some time, appear in the eye,
which enlarge until they cover it entirely, and prevent the
ingress of light. It is probable that they possessed no
rational remedy for this evil previously to their acquaintance
with the traders, excepting the extracting of blood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
from the temple by their process of cupping; the traders,
however, have taught them to remove the opacity, by
blowing burnt alum into the eye through a quill, a remedy
so familiar in the veterinary art. To this disease children
as well as adults are obnoxious.</p>

<p>Another ophthalmia, which also results in the destruction
of the faculty of vision, commences with a superabundant
secretion of the fluid of the lachrymal duct,
succeeded by inflammation of the lids; the sight becomes
gradually debilitated, until at length the pupil assumes an
opake white appearance; probably fistula lachrymalis.</p>

<p>Temporary blindness, which sometimes eventuates in
permanent loss of sight, occurs during the winter to incautious
travellers who pass over the prairies covered with
snow, from which the solar light is so brilliantly reflected.
A party that accompanied Mr. Dougherty on a journey,
being thus exposed, became unable to distinguish objects,
and had not his sight been preserved, they might never
have regained their stockade.</p>

<p>The blind are not neglected by their family and friends;
on the contrary, we had several opportunities of observing
them to be well clothed and fed, and much at their ease.
When superannuated, however, they are not exempted
from the fate attendant on that state.</p>

<p>An affection, or pain in the breast, distinguished by the
name of Mong-ga-ne-a, seems to be the consequence of
excessive indulgence in tobacco, and the {241} habitual
inhaling of the smoke of it into the lungs. In their attempts
to alleviate this complaint, the magi affect to extract from
the part, by suction, balls and pellets of hair, and other
extraneous substances, which they had previously concealed
in their mouths for the purpose of deceiving the
patient.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p>An individual applied to one of our party to cure him of
this pain, but being advised to desist from the indulgence
of tobacco smoking, he appeared rather willing to
bear with his disease.</p>

<p>They sometimes say that their liver pains them, a disorder
which they call Ta-pe-ne-a.</p>

<p>They are not exempt from catarrhs, the consequence of
great exposure to sudden vicissitudes of temperature; a
disease similar to the influenza is sometimes prevalent, and
known by the name of Hoh-pa.</p>

<p>A deaf and dumb boy occurred in the Oto nation; an
adult with a curved spine; and another with an inflexible
knee, the leg forming a right angle with the thigh. But
we have not observed any one of them with either eye
deviating from the true line of vision.</p>

<p>The medical and surgical knowledge of the Omawhaws
is very inconsiderable, and what there is, is so much blended
with ceremonies, which to us appear superstitious, inert,
and absurd, that it would seem, that, with the exception of
a few instances, they have no reasonable mode of practice.</p>

<p>Sweating-baths are much in estimation, and are used
for the cure of many ailments. These are temporary constructions,
generally placed near the edge of a water-course;
they are formed of osiers, or small pliant branches of trees,
stuck into the soil in a circular arrangement, bent over at
top so as to form a hemispherical figure, and covered in
every part with bison robes. They are of different sizes,
some are calculated to contain but a single individual,
whilst others afford space for five or six at once. The invalid
enters with a kettle of water and some heated {242}
stones, on which the water is sprinkled until the steam
produced is sufficient for his purpose. When they conceive
that his perspiration has been as profuse as necessary,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
he is taken out and plunged into the water, and even
if the stream be covered with ice, this is broken to admit
the patient. He is not subjected a second time to the
action of the steam, but covers himself with his robe and
returns home.</p>

<p>We did not learn that they possessed any knowledge of
cathartic or emetic medicines. But as a substitute for the
latter, a feather is thrust down the throat, until its irritating
effect produces vomiting.</p>

<p>For the cure of cholic, warm topical applications are
made, and the abdomen is kneaded with the fist.</p>

<p>They have no substitute whatever for opium, and we
do not know that they have any for mercury.</p>

<p>For the alleviation of an internal local pain, a severe
remedy is sometimes resorted to. A portion of the
medullary substance of a plant, is attached to the skin
over the part affected, by means of a little spittle; it is
then touched with fire, and burns slowly down to the skin,
upon which a vesication is soon produced, and accomplishes
the object intended, of removing, at least for a time,
the internal pain to the surface. This seems to be the
only species of actual cautery made use of.</p>

<p>The Indians, who reside in the upper regions of the Missouri,
practise bleeding for various ailments. This operation
is sometimes performed with a knife or arrow point.
At other times, and not unusually, a sharp stone is placed
upon the part from which blood is to be drawn, and it is
then struck with a stick, much in the same manner that
veterinarians operate with the phlegm. They thus bleed
in the arm, thigh, leg, &amp;c.</p>

<p>They never dissect the human body, expressly for the
purpose of acquiring a knowledge of its structure; but
they have a general idea of the position of the vitals and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
viscera, acquired upon the field of battle, {243} by their
custom of hacking the carcasses of the slain; a knowledge
which teaches them on what part of the body of an
enemy to strike, in order that the wound may be mortal.</p>

<p>Gun-shot wounds are administered to by the magi, who
powwow over them, rattle their gourds and sing, whilst
they chew roots and blow out the fragments and saliva on
the part. But the efficient practice in cases of wounds of
this nature, is their system of depuration by means of suction;
they apply their lips to the wound, and draw out the
pus as it is secreted; by this mode of treatment they seem
to be very successful in the cure of gun-shot wounds.</p>

<p>Amputation of limbs is not practised in their surgery.</p>

<p>The wound produced by the arrow, is treated much in
the same manner with that of the gun-shot, after the
weapon is thrust through the part, in the direction in
which it entered; or, if this cannot be accomplished, the
arrow is withdrawn, and the head or point being very
slightly attached to the shaft, remains in the body, unless
the wound is superficial, in which case it is cut out with a
knife.</p>

<p>A broken limb is extended to its place, and enveloped
with a leathern strap; the union generally takes place
promptly, but the member usually remains more or less
bent or crooked.</p>

<p>They have no rational mode of treating the scalp wound.
A squaw who had been scalped, covered the part, after its
edges had healed, with a peruke made of bison hair, until
the hair on the other parts of her head became of sufficient
length to conceal the deformity.</p>

<p>Dislocated members are reduced by extension, but with
so little art, that they are frequently unsuccessful, and the
limb remains permanently disjointed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>The Omawhaws are entirely destitute of all condiments,
with the exception of salt, which, however, in their eating,
they rarely use.</p>

<p>{244} Confirmed insanity appears to be unknown.</p>

<p>Every person, in any degree conversant with Indian
manners and customs, is struck with their proneness to
that most abominable and degrading of all vices, intoxication
from the use of spirituous liquors. The Missouri
Indians, collectively, form no exception to this general
trait. A member of the Pawnee war party, which we so
unfortunately encountered near the Konza village, was
more solicitous to obtain a draft of this pernicious beverage,
than to possess any other article within his view. We,
however, persisted in refusing it to him, although he fell
upon his knees, and laid his hands convulsively upon his
breast and stomach, crying out, with a voice and manner
of earnest supplication, "Whiskey, whiskey." The vice
of drunkenness is yet, however, extremely rare in the Pawnee,
as well as the Konza nation. But the Omawhaws
are much addicted to it, and, with the exception of the
chiefs, the indulgence does not, in any very considerable
measure, degrade them in the estimation of their countrymen,
who regard it as a delightful frolick; unless, indeed,
the indulgence is permitted to grow into a habit.</p>

<p>To this cause, more especially than to any other, is perhaps
attributable the depreciation of the influence of Ongpatonga,
notwithstanding the efforts of his comparatively
superior intellectual abilities.</p>

<p>The greatest offences and insults are overlooked if committed
in this state, and even murder is palliated by it.
The actions of drunken Indians, are as ridiculous and
puerile as those of civilized drunkards; chiefs, warriors,
and common men, roll indiscriminately on the earth together,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
or dance, caper, laugh, cry, shout, fight, or hug
and kiss, and rub each other with their hands, in the most
affectionate or stupid manner. If in the vicinity of white
people, they appoint some of their number to remain sober,
in order to prevent injury or insult being offered to them.</p>

<p>{245} The squaws sometimes tie them with cords, in
order to preserve the peace, and are thanked for their
precaution, when the subjects return to the dignity of
reason.</p>

<p>Squaws, however, will themselves get drunk on certain
occasions, and children are frequently intoxicated with
liquor given them by the parents.</p>

<p>Whiskey, which is the only spirituous liquor they are
acquainted with, is furnished to them freely by the traders;
and the existing law of the United States, prohibiting the
sale of it to the natives, is readily evaded, by presenting it
to them with a view of securing their custom, not in direct,
although implied exchange for their peltries. Nor is this
greatest of evils in the power of the agent to remedy; and
until traders are effectually interdicted, by law, from taking
any whiskey into the country, even for their own consumption,
it must, in defiance of his authority, continue to
exist.</p>

<p>Whiskey is distinguished by the appellation of Pa-je-ne,
or <i>fire-water</i>, the letter <i>j</i> having the French sound in pronunciation.
The state of intoxication is called Ta-ne, a
word which has a singular affinity with that by which they
distinguish meat broth, or <i>meat water</i>; so great indeed is
the similarity in sound between them, that to our ear they
appear identical.</p>

<p>Intoxicating drinks do not appear to be ever made use
of by the Omawhaws, for superstitious purposes.</p>

<p>This people believe firmly in an existence after death;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
but they do not appear to have any definite notions as to
the state in which they shall then be. And although they
say that many reappear after death to their relatives, yet
such visitants communicate no information respecting
futurity. They consist of those only who have been
killed either in battle with the enemy, or in quarrels with
individuals of their own nation, and their errand is to solicit
vengeance on the perpetrators of the deed.</p>

<p>{246} Futurity has no terrors to the dying Omawhaw. as
he has no idea of actual punishment beyond his present
state of existence. He, however, regrets the parting from
his family and friends, and sometimes expresses his fears
that the former will be impoverished, when his exertions
for their support shall be withdrawn.</p>

<p>The Wahconda is believed to be the greatest and best of
beings, the creator and preserver of all things, and the
fountain of mystic medicine. Omniscience, omnipresence,
and vast power are attributed to him, and he is supposed
to afflict them with sickness, poverty, or misfortune, for
their evil deeds. In conversation he is frequently appealed
to as an evidence of the truth of their asseverations,
in the words Wahconda-wa-nah-kong, the Wahconda
hears what I say; and they sometimes add Mun-ekuh-wa-nah-kong,
the earth hears what I say.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the notions of other Indian nations,
we did not learn that the Omawhaws have any distinct
ideas of the existence of the devil; or at least we always
experienced much difficulty and delay, when obtaining
vocabularies of this and some other languages in ascertaining
corresponding words for <i>Devil</i> and <i>Hell</i>: the Indians
would consult together, and in one instance the interpreter
told us they were coining a word.</p>

<p>They say that after death, those who have conducted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
themselves properly in this life, are received into the Wa-noch-a-te,
or town of brave and generous spirits; but those
who have not been useful to the nation or their own families,
by killing their enemies, stealing horses, or by generosity,
will have a residence prepared for them in the town
of poor and useless spirits; where, as well as in the good
town, their usual avocations are continued.</p>

<p>Their Wahconda seems to be a Protean god; he is supposed
to appear to different persons under different forms.
All those who are favoured with his {247} presence become
medicine men or magicians, in consequence of thus
having seen and conversed with the Wahconda, and of
having received from him some particular medicine
of wondrous efficacy.</p>

<p>He appeared to one in the shape of a grizzly bear, to
another in that of a bison, to a third in that of a beaver, or
owl, &amp;c., and an individual attributed to an animal, from
which he received his medicine, the form and features of
the elephant.</p>

<p>All the magi, in the administration of their medicine to
the sick or afflicted, mimic the action and voice, variously
exaggerated and modified, of the animal, which, they say,
is their respective medicine, or in other words, that in
which the Wahconda appeared to them.</p>

<p>When a magician is called to attend a sick person, he
makes preparations for the visit by washing and painting
with red clay; some of them dress fantastically, but others
retain their ordinary apparel, which does not distinguish
them from their neighbours; they take with them a dried
gourd or skin, in which are some pebbles or plumstones,
to make a rattling noise; the medicine bag is also an indispensable
requisite, not for the active properties of its contents,
but for the mystic virtues ascribed to them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>When in presence of his patient, he assumes the proper
gravity of deportment, and commences his operations by
smoking his pipe, and talking to his Wahconda; after this
preparatory ceremony, the medicine bag is opened, and
the contents displayed, consisting of white and red earth,
herbs entire or pulverized, &amp;c. Portions of these are
mixed with warm water, in small wooden cups, with which
he is provided. Then, with a due degree of solemnity, he
advances to his patient, and inquires into the nature of his
ailment; he feels the part affected with his hand, and in
case of local pain, he scarifies the part with a flint, and
proceeds to suck out the blood, {248} having previously
taken a small quantity of water in his mouth. He applies
his lips to the wound, and sucks with great force, drawing
a considerable quantity of blood, which he occasionally
ejects into a bowl, in which some dirt or ashes had
been previously sprinkled.</p>

<p>He makes much noise in the operation, by inhaling and
expelling the air forcibly through his nostrils, and at the
same time jerks his head from side to side, tugging at the
part to facilitate the process. The depletion produced by
this method, is sometimes so considerable that the patient
becomes relaxed and pallid.</p>

<p>It has been remarked, that those practitioners have very
tumid lips, and this remark is verified in those of Mon-cha-wahconda,
or medicine grizzly bear, whom we have
frequently seen.</p>

<p>If the patient has no local pain, the magician administers
some of his simples, sometimes internally, but generally
by friction between his warmed hands, and the
breast or abdomen of the patient. At intervals during
this operation, and after the termination of it, he rattles
his gourd with violence, singing to it with great vehemence,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
and throwing himself into grotesque attitudes. All this is
sometimes daily repeated, until the convalescence or death
of the patient.</p>

<p>A wealthy man, when sick, will sometimes send to a
great distance for a celebrated practitioner, who, if not
already engaged, removes with his family and lodge to the
vicinity of the afflicted.</p>

<p>The compensation for all this attendance and powwowing,
is proportioned to the violence and duration of the
complaint, and to the wealth of the individual; it is frequently
exorbitant, and consists of horses, kettles, blankets,
&amp;c., which, although they are never demanded, yet
the magician does not fail to allude to some of them as
objects of his wishes, and {249} the gratitude of the patient
seldom fails on this occasion. If the patient dies, notwithstanding
all this necromancy, he is said to be summoned
by the Wahconda, and the fee or present to the magician is
made by the relatives or friends of the deceased.</p>

<p>These men sometimes pretend to the spirit of prophecy.
One of them ventured to predict, that two squaws who
had recently married white men, would die in the course
of a very short time, which he specified. The squaws
being much alarmed at the prospect of approaching death,
took with them some tobacco and other presents, and went
in search of the prophet in order to prevail upon him to
intercede for them with the Wahconda, and avert their
doom. The husband of one of the squaws, a citizen of the
United States, hearing of the occurrence, went to the lodge
of the magician. He was surprised to see there the squaws
perfectly naked before the magician, who had provided
himself with a large kettle of warm water, and was himself
engaged in squirting the water from his mouth over their
persons. The husband, incensed at what appeared to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
him to be nonsense and imposition, kicked over the kettle
of holy water, and drove the squaws home to their lodges;
but the magician, having received the presents, which were
the objects of his swindling cunning, pretended that his
incantation had had the desired effect with the Wahconda,
inducing him to spare their lives.</p>

<p>Many are the impostures which these priests practise on
the credulity of the people. And although they are frequently
defeated in their attempts to deceive, and justly
punished for their hypocritical villainy, yet the advantage
of experience seems to profit them little, and deception,
practised under a new garb, often attains its ends. How
can we wonder at this facility, with which a simple people
are blinded, through the medium of their superstitious faith,
when we know that infinitely more {250} monstrous absurdities
obtain the inconsiderate assent, or excite the fears
of thousands of civilized men, in the most populous and
enlightened cities of Europe and America, and that the
horse-shoe, even at this day, is frequently seen attached to
the threshold of a door, as a security against the entrance
of a witch?</p>

<p>One of these magi acquired a high repute in several of
the Missouri nations, by impressing them with the belief,
that his body was indestructible to human power, and
that if cut into a thousand fragments, and scattered to the
winds, these portions would all promptly assemble together
again, and become revivified, so that he would receive
no injury from the operation. Trusting to his fame,
on some slight provocation, he killed a squaw in the midst
of her own people, and with the most unbounded confidence,
surrendered himself to her exasperated relatives,
declaring with exultation that they possessed not the
power to harm him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p>Unexpectedly, however, they put his vaunted supernatural
constitution to the test, by dividing his body into
pieces, and scattering them about the vicinity of the village.</p>

<p>They are so entirely habituated to practising the arts of
deception, that it would seem they sometimes persuade
themselves that what was at first only feigned, is in truth
reality, and that their magic absolutely possesses its attributed
healing virtue. One of these men, being on a
visit to the Pawnee villages, was present at a kind of grand
incantation, during which many extraordinary feats were
exhibited. He there saw, for the first time, the mountebank
trick, of appearing to cut off the tongue, and afterwards
replacing the severed portion without a wound.
"There," said Katterfelto, "your medicine is not strong
enough to enable you to perform this operation." The
stranger, jealous of his national honour, and unwilling to
be exceeded, unhesitatingly {251} drew forth his knife, and
actually cut off nearly the whole of his tongue, and bled
to death before their eyes.</p>

<p>In the country of the Crow Indians, (Up-sa-ro-ka,)<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
Mr. Dougherty saw a singular arrangement of the magi.
The upper portion of a cotton-wood tree was implanted
with its base in the earth, and around it was a sweat house,
the upper part of the top of the tree arising through the
roof. A gray bison skin, extended with oziers on the inside
so as to exhibit a natural appearance, was suspended
above the house, and on the branches were attached several
pairs of children's mockasins and leggings, and from
one of the limbs of the tree, a very large fan made of war
eagle's feathers was dependent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<p>The Missouri Indians believe earthquakes to be the
effect of supernatural agency, connected, like the thunder,
with the immediate operations of the Master of Life. The
earthquakes which, in the year 1811, almost destroyed the
town of New Madrid of the Mississippi, were very sensibly
felt on the upper portion of the Missouri country, and occasioned
much superstitious dread amongst the Indians.
During that period, a citizen of the United States resided
in the village of the Otos, trading for the produce of their
hunts. One day he was surprised by a visit of a number
of Otos in anger. They said that a Frenchman, who was
also trading in the village, had informed them, that the
Big-knives had killed a son of the Master of Life; that they
had seen him riding on a white horse in a forest country,
and being of a sanguinary disposition, they had waylaid
and shot him. And it was certainly owing to this act that
the earth was now trembling before the anger of the great Wahconda.
They believed the story implicitly, and it
was with no little difficulty that the trader divested his
own nation of the singular crimination.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>{252} As connected with the superstitions of the Missouri
Indians, we may mention some anecdotes that came to our
knowledge. First, of the Me-ma-ho-pa or medicine stone
of the <i>Gros ventres</i>, or Minnetarees.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> This is a large,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
naked, and insulated rock, situate in the midst of a small
prairie, at the distance of about two days' journey, southwest
of the village of that nation. In shape it resembles
the steep roof of a house. The Minnetarees resort to it,
for the purpose of propitiating their Man-ho-pa or Great
Spirit, by presents, by fasting, and lamentation, during the
space of from three to five days.</p>

<p>An individual, who intends to perform this ceremony,
takes some presents with him, such as a gun, horse, or
strouding, and also provides a smooth skin, upon which
hieroglyphics may be drawn, and repairs to the rock accompanied
by his friends and magi. On his arrival, he
deposits the presents there, and after smoking to the rock,
he washes a portion of the face of it clean, and retires with
his fellow devotees to a specified distance. During the
principal part of his stay, he cries aloud to his god to have
pity on him; to grant him success in war and in hunting;
to favour his endeavours to take prisoners, horses, and
scalps from the enemy. When the appointed time for
lamentation and prayer has elapsed, he returns to the rock;
his presents are no longer there, and he believes them to
have been accepted and carried off by the Manhopa himself.
Upon the part of the rock, which he had washed, he
finds certain hieroglyphics traced with white clay, of which
he can generally interpret the meaning, particularly when
assisted by some of the magi, who were no doubt privy to
the whole transaction. These representations are supposed
to relate to his future fortune, or to that of his family
or nation; he copies them off with pious care {253} and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
scrupulous exactness upon the skin which he brought for
the purpose, and returns to his home, to read from them to
the people, the destiny of himself or of them. If a bear
be represented, with its head directed towards the village,
the approach of a war party, or the visitation of some evil,
is apprehended. If, on the contrary, the tail of the bear
be towards the village, nothing but good is anticipated,
and they rejoice. They say that an Indian, on his return
from the rock, exhibited to his friends, on his hieroglyphical
chart, the representation of a strange building, as erected
near the village; they were all much surprised and did
not perfectly comprehend its meaning; but four months
afterwards, the prediction was, as it happened, verified,
and a stockade trading house was erected there, by the
French trader Jessaume.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>Lewis and Clark inform us that the Mandans have a
similar oracle.</p>

<p>At the distance of the journey of one day and a half from
Knife-creek,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> which divides the larger and smaller towns
of the Minnetarees from each other, are situate two conical
hills, separated by about the distance of a mile. One of
these hills was supposed to impart a prolific virtue to such
squaws as resorted to it for the purpose of crying and lamenting,
for the circumstance of their having no male
issue.</p>

<p>A person one day walking near the other mount, fancied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
he observed upon the top of it, two very small children.
Thinking they had strayed from the village, he ran towards
them to induce them to return home; but they immediately
fled from him, nor could his utmost speed overtake them,
and in a short time they eluded his sight. Returning to
the village, the relation of his story excited much interest,
and an Indian set out next day, mounted on a fleet horse,
to take the little strangers. On the approach of this individual
to the mount, he also saw the children, who ran
away as before, and although he endeavoured to overtake
them by lashing the horse into {254} his utmost swiftness,
the children left him far behind. But these children are no
longer to be seen, and the hill once of singular efficacy in
rendering the human species prolific, has lost this remarkable
property—A change, which the magi attribute to
the moral degeneracy of the present generation of the <i>Gros
ventres</i>. Thus, like many of the asserted supernatural
occurrences in the civilized world, these are referred back,
in their obscure tradition, "out of harm's way."</p>

<p>Lewis and Clark, however, inform us, that the Sioux
have a belief somewhat similar, respecting a hill near
Whitestone River,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> which they fable to be at present occupied
by a small and dangerous race of people, about
eighteen inches high, and with remarkably large heads,
who, having killed three Omawhaws a few years since,
have inspired all the neighbouring Indians with a superstitious
dread. Although these intrepid travellers visited
the haunted hill, they were happy enough to escape the
vengeance of its Lilliputian inhabitants.</p>

<p>With this absurd, but somewhat poetical fable, may be
classed the asserted discovery of Lilliputian skeletons of
men on the banks of the Merameg river, and the osteological
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
acumen of the discoverers of those relics, may derive
all the support which their theory is susceptible of
receiving, from the story of these visionary beings.</p>

<p>Annually, in the month of July, the Minnetarees celebrate
their great medicine dance, or dance of penitence,
which may well be compared with the Currack-pooja of
the expiatory tortures of the Hindoos, so often celebrated
at Calcutta. On this occasion a considerable quantity of
food is prepared, which is well cooked, and served up in
their best manner. The devotees then dance and sing to
their music at intervals, for three or four days together in
full view of the victuals, without attempting to taste of them.
But they do not, even at this time, forego {255} their accustomed
hospitality. And if a stranger enters, he is invited
to eat, though no one partakes with him. On the third or
fourth day, the severer expiatory tortures commence, to
which the preceding ceremonies were but preludes. An individual
presents himself before one of the officiating magi,
crying and lamenting, and requests him to cut a fillet of skin
from his arm, which he extends for that purpose. The devout
operator thrusts a sharp instrument through the skin
near the wrist, then introduces the knife, and cuts out a piece
of the required length, sometimes extending the excision
entirely to the shoulder. Another will request bands of
skin to be cut from his arm. A third will have his breast
flayed, so as to represent a full moon or crescent. A
fourth submits to the removal of concentric arcs of skin
from his breast. A fifth prays the operator to remove
small pieces of skin from various indicated parts of his
body; for this purpose an iron bodkin is thrust through the
skin, and the piece is cut off, by passing the knife under
the instrument.</p>

<p>Various are the forms of suffering which they inflict upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
themselves. An individual requests the operator to pierce
a hole through the skin of each of his shoulders, and after
passing a long cord through each of these holes, he repairs
to a Golgotha at some distance from the village, and selects
one of the bison skulls collected there. To the chosen
cranium he affixes the ends of his cords, and drags it in
this painful manner to the lodge, round which he must go
with his burden, before he can be released from it. No one
is permitted to assist him, neither dares he to put his own
hands to the cords, to alleviate his sufferings. If it should
so happen that the horns of the cranium get hooked under
a root or other obstacle, he must extricate it in the best
manner he can, by pulling different ways, but he must not
touch the rope or the head with his hands, or in any respect
attempt to relieve the painful strain upon his wounds,
until his complete task is performed.</p>

<p>{256} Some of the penitents have arrows thrust through
various muscular parts of their bodies, as through the skin
and superficial muscles of the arm, leg, breast, and back.</p>

<p>A devotee caused two stout arrows to be passed through
the muscles of his breast, one on each side, near the mamm&aelig;.
To these arrows cords were attached, the opposite
ends of which were affixed to the upper part of a post,
which had been firmly implanted in the earth for the purpose.
He then threw himself backward, into an oblique
position, his back within about two feet of the soil, so as to
depend with the greater portion of his weight by the cords.
In this situation of excruciating agony, he continued to
chaunt and to keep time to the music of the gong, until,
from long abstinence and suffering, he fainted. The bystanders
then cried out, "Courage, courage," with much
shouting and noise; after a short interval of insensibility
he revived, and proceeded with his self-inflicted tortures
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
as before, until nature being completely exhausted, he
again relapsed into insensibility, upon which he was loosed
from the cords, and carried off amidst the acclamations of
the whole assembly.</p>

<p>Another Minnetaree, in compliance with a vow he had
made, caused a hole to be perforated through the muscles
of each shoulder; through these holes cords were passed,
which were, at the opposite ends, attached by way of a
bridle to a horse, that had been penned up three or four
days without food or water. In this manner, he led the
horse to the margin of the river. The horse, of course,
endeavoured to drink, but it was the province of the Indian
to prevent him, and that only by straining at the cords
with the muscles of the shoulder, without resorting to the
assistance of his hands. And notwithstanding all the
exertions of the horse to drink, his master succeeded in preventing
him, and returned with him to his lodge, having
accomplished his painful task.</p>

<p>{257} The Wolf chief,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> one of the most eminent of the
warriors of the upper village of the Minnetarees, on one
occasion, sat five days, singing and lamenting, without
food, on a small insulated and naked rock in the Missouri
river. And it is firmly believed that he did not even
palliate his urgent wants by tasting the water during this
long probation.</p>

<p>Many of the Minnetarees believe that the bones of those
bisons, which they have slain and divested of flesh, rise
again clothed with renewed flesh, and quickened with life,
and become fat, and fit for slaughtering the succeeding
June. They assert that some of their nation, who were
formerly on a hunting excursion, lost one of their party, a
boy, and returned to the village lamenting his loss, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
believing him to have been killed by the Sioux nation,
with whom they were then at war. Some time afterward,
a war party was assembled, that departed to revenge the
supposed murder of the boy. During their journey, they
espied a bison, which they pursued and killed. When lo!
on opening the abdomen of the animal, what was their
astonishment to observe the long-lost boy, alive and well,
after having been imprisoned there one entire year. Relieved
from his animated prison-house, he informed
them, that, when he left his hunting companions, he proceeded
onward a considerable distance, until he was so
fortunate as to kill this bison. He removed the flesh from
one side of the animal, and as a rainy inclement night was
approaching, he concluded to take shelter within the body
of the animal, in place of the viscera, which he had taken
out. But during the night, whilst he slept, the flesh of the
bison that he had cut off, grew over the side again, and
effectually prevented his getting out, and the animal being
restored to life, he had thus been pent up ever since.</p>

<p>Such anecdotes, however puerile and absurd they may
be, if characteristic, lead us to a more accurate {258} and
complete knowledge of the manners and habits of the
people, than still more copious general remarks and reflections.</p>

<p>The Minnetarees, in common with several other nations
of our Indians, have the strange tradition of their origin,
that they formerly lived underground. "Two boys," say
they, "strayed away from them, and absented themselves
several days. At length they returned and informed the
nation that they had discovered another world, situate
above their present residence, where all was beautiful and
light. They saw the sun, the earth, the Missouri, and the
bison. This account so delighted the people, that they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
immediately abandoned their subterranean dwelling, and,
led by the boys, arrived on the surface of the earth, at the
spot which their villages now occupy, and where they have
dwelt ever since.</p>

<p>"Soon after they had established themselves in this new
world, a party of strange men appeared mounted on horses.
They attacked these wonderful Centaurs with their bows
and arrows, and succeeded in killing one of them, on which
the others fled. Not at first perceiving that the man and
horse were two distinct animals, they were surprised to see
the former fall to the earth, as if one part of the compound
animal was dead and the other part still active, having
received no injury. They at length succeeded in securing
the horse, and after admiring the beauty of his form, and
becoming familiar with him, they proceeded to tie one of
their young men upon his back with cords, that he might
not fall off; the horse was then led cautiously by the bridle,
until finally he became sufficiently fearless to ride alone."</p>

<p>They seem to have full faith in the notion that, at their
death, they will be restored to the mansions of their ancestors
under ground, from which they are intercepted by
a large and rapid watercourse. Over this river, which
may be compared to the Styx of the ancients, they are
obliged to pass on a very narrow {259} footway. Those Indians
who have been useful to the nation, such as brave
warriors or good hunters, pass over with ease, and arrive
safely at the A-pah-he, or ancient village. But the worthless
Indians slip off from the bridge or footway, into the
stream that foams beneath in the swiftness of its course,
which hurries them into oblivion, or Lethe. The Mandans,
according to Lewis and Clarke, have a tradition somewhat
similar, and it strongly reminds us of the Alsirat of Mahomet,
over which, it was supposed, that great leader was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
to conduct his Moslems to the bliss of futurity, whilst the
unworthy were precipitated into the gulf which yawned
beneath it.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p class="hang">Death—Mourning for the Deceased—Physical Character—Senses—Manufactures
and Arts—Domestic
and Warlike Implements—War.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> an Omawhaw dies, his kinsmen and friends
assemble around his body, and bewail their loss with
loud lamentation, weeping, and clapping of hands. Ong-pa-ton-ga,
being once on a visit to St. Louis, observed
a number of cattle gathering about a spot, where one of
their kind had been recently slaughtered, smelling the
blood, and pawing the earth; he said they behaved very
like his own people, on the death of a relative.</p>

<p>They suffer the deceased to remain but a short time
previously to interment, and often bear the body to the
grave, before the warmth of vitality is entirely dissipated.
The body is enveloped in a bison robe, or blanket, which
is secured by a cord. It is then carried to the grave on
the shoulders of two or three men, and followed by the
greater portion of the mourners, without any order. The
grave is an oblong square, of sufficient length, and four
or five feet deep. The body is placed in the grave, and
{2} with it a pair or two of mockasins, some meat for
food, and many little articles and comforts, the gifts of
affection, to be used on the long journey which the deceased
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
is supposed to be about to perform, in order to
arrive at the Wa-noch-a-te, or town of brave and generous
spirits. The grave is then filled with earth, and a small
tumulus is raised over it, proportioned in magnitude to
the dignity of the deceased. The relatives bedaub their
persons with white clay, scarify themselves with a flint,
cut out pieces of their skin and flesh, pass arrows through
their skin; and, if on a march, they walk barefoot at
a distance from their people, in testimony of the sincerity
of their mourning.</p>

<p>For a considerable time, they nightly visit the grave of
the deceased, to lament over it. A sorrowing relative
may be seen, of a bleak wintry night, bending over the
grave, clad in a scanty robe, which scarcely conceals the
middle of the back, as an additional self-punishment
and unequivocal manifestation of grief.</p>

<p>For the death of a brave warrior, or of a chief, the
lamentation is more general, and many of those who
visit the body previous to its removal, present to it blankets,
bison robes, breech-cloths, and mockasins, which are
sometimes thus accumulated in considerable numbers;
of these presents, part is retained by the orphans, if any,
but the greater number is entombed with the body. Over
the grave of a person of this description, a kind of roof
or shelter is constructed, of pieces of wood reared against
each other, and secured at top, then sodded over with
grass sod.</p>

<p>The season prescribed by custom for mourning, is a
period of from seven to twelve months; during this time
the violent expressions of their grief gradually diminish,
and towards the expiration of the allotted season, the
state of mourning is only manifested by the coating of
white clay, and even this, like the black apparel of civilized
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
mourners, is at length {3} dispensed with, and with the
same decorous gradation.</p>

<p>A cruel proof of heartfelt grief, is exhibited by some of
the natives, on the upper parts of the Missouri; they cut
off joints of their fingers; the individual cuts the skin
and ligaments of the joint with his common eating knife,
then places the joint between his teeth, and twists it off
with violence, the teeth performing at the same time
the offices of a wedge and a vice.</p>

<p>In form, the Missouri Indian is symmetrical and active,
and in stature, equal, if not somewhat superior, to the
ordinary European standard; tall men are numerous.
The active occupations of war and hunting, together
perhaps with the occasional privations, to which they are
subjected, prevents that unsightly obesity, so often a
concomitant of civilization, indolence, and serenity of
mental temperament.</p>

<p>From this representation of the physical man, it is
obvious that our observations do not correspond with
those of Humboldt, regarding the natives of Canada,
Florida, and New Spain, in as far as he represents them
with the "squat body."</p>

<p>The forehead retires remarkably backward, and the
posterior part of the head (occiput) has a flatness of
appearance, attributable, perhaps, to the circumstance
of its having rested so constantly during infancy, on the
surface of a board, or on the scarcely less yielding interposed
pad or pillow. Yet that organ, to which, in the
phrenological system, the seat of amativeness is referred,
although not usually very prominent, is still marked and
distinct.</p>

<p>The facial angle of the cranium has been represented
by Blumenbach at 73 degrees, an obliquity which induced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
him to place the American Indian in his series of the
varieties of the human race, as the fourth in number.</p>

<p>But his observations were made upon the cranium of
a Carib, than which people, as Humboldt justly {4}
remarks, "there is no race on the globe in which the
frontal bone is more depressed backwards, or which has
a less projecting forehead." This observation will not
rigidly apply to the western Indian, who certainly possesses
a greater verticality of profile. Agreeably to the
mensurations of Doctor Harlan,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> a cranium, which we
obtained on the plains of the Platte, exhibits an angle of 78
degrees—A Wabash male 78&deg;, female 80&deg;, and a Cherokee
only 75&deg;.</p>

<p>The hair is coarse, black, glossy, and dense upon the
head, sparse and slender upon the chin, independently
of the custom of extirpating it, but although the hair is
certainly oval in its transverse section, yet we could not
perceive, that, in this respect, its proportions exceeded
our own.</p>

<p>The line of the direction of their eyes is nearly rectilinearly
transverse, being in this respect intermediate
between the arcuated line of the eyes of the white man,
and that of the Indians of New Spain, who, according to
Humboldt, have the corner of the eye directed upward
towards the temples.</p>

<p>The nose is generally prominent, and either aquiline
or Roman, with the wings not more dilated than those of
white men. This form of nose is so prevalent, as to be
regarded as the most beautiful; it is no small compliment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
to tell a person that his nose is like that of a mule; and
beauty is indicated in their language of signs, by placing
an arcuated finger upon the face in imitation of the
aquiline curve. The <i>pug-nose</i>, and the more common
form of the noses of the white Americans, of a concave
outline, are regarded as remote from the standard of
beauty.</p>

<p>The lips are more tumid than those of the white American,
but very far less so than those of the negro.</p>

<p>The lower jaw is large and robust; the teeth are very
strong, with broad crowns. The chin is well formed.</p>

<p>{5} The cheekbones are prominent, but not angular
like those of the Mongul, and stamp a peculiarity on the
contour of the face, characteristic of the American Indian.</p>

<p>The expression of the countenance is austere, often
ferocious.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>Very few of them are left-handed, perhaps even a
smaller number of them use the left hand in preference
to the right, than is observable among white men.</p>

<p>The squaw differs from the males, in having a more
squat figure, or is shorter and more thick bodied, with
a much broader face.</p>

<p>The colour of the Indian is, according to Volney, that
of the skin of smoked bacon ham. It is sufficiently
obvious that this colour is independent of climate; those
parts of the body, which are, and, agreeably to their
representations, always have been, perfectly shielded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
from the action of the rays of the sun, from their youth
upward, are, notwithstanding, of the same tint with the
face, which is never covered.</p>

<p>In walking they preserve a perfectly upright carriage
of the person, without any thing of the swinging gait so
universal with the white people, which is regarded by
them as excessively awkward, and which they imitate
in their sports to excite the merriment of the spectators,
though not in the presence of those whom they thus
ridicule.</p>

<p>In stepping the feet are universally placed upon the
ground in a parallel manner with each other; they say
that turning out the toes in walking, as well as turning
them inward, is a very disadvantageous mode of progression,
in high grass or in narrow pathways.</p>

<p>The peculiar odour diffused by the body of the Indian,
seems to be caused, not so much by the cutaneous transpiration,
as by the custom of rubbing themselves with
odoriferous plants, and with bison {6} grease. They also
sometimes make necklaces of a sort of sweet-scented
grass, and suspend small parcels of it about their persons.
The various kinds of pigments, with which they overspread
their persons, may also be partially operative in
producing this effect; and the ninnegahe, which they are
so constantly habituated to smoke, is doubtless another
agent.</p>

<p>The odour of the Indian is rather agreeable than
otherwise to many, and that diffused by the persons of
the Pawnee war party near the Konza village, increased
by a profuse perspiration from the violence of their
exercise in running, was rather pleasant to most of the
members of our party. The Upsaroka or Crow Indians,
are said to anoint themselves with castor.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p>To the acute sense of smelling of the Indian, the odour
of the white man is far from pleasant, and is often particularly
remarked by the squaw to be offensive.</p>

<p>Their sense of hearing is remarkably acute; ordinary
conversation amongst the men, as we have before observed,
is conducted in a low tone of voice; often when
you suppose from the compass of the speaker's voice,
that he is addressing a person at his elbow, he is, in reality,
directing his discourse to one on the opposite side of the
room, or at a considerable distance. The ordinary conversation
of the women is in a much louder tone than that
of the men. Partial deafness, however, is not uncommon.</p>

<p>The memory of the Omawhaw is exceedingly retentive.</p>

<p>The Omawhaw seldom renders himself unhappy with
gloomy anticipations of the future, but almost literally
takes "no care for the morrow." He will say to his
squaw, "cook what meat you have, for the Wahconda
will give us more to-morrow, and if not to-morrow, next
day, and if never, let us eat what we have got."</p>

<p>{7} They have but little mechanical ingenuity, but an
individual of this nation, who is now no more, without
acquiring any knowledge of the white people, as far as
we could learn, mended the guns and traps of his countrymen,
when not too seriously injured. But they have not
attempted to repair either, since his death.</p>

<p>They rarely construct skin canoes; they make war-clubs,
rude saddles, hair ropes, stone pipes, wooden
bowls, horn spoons, and many personal ornaments.</p>

<p>The squaws make mockasins and leggings variously
ornamented; and handsome necklaces, wrought with
beads of different colours, which are symmetrically strung
upon red silk, or thread coloured with vermillion. In
the manufacture of this common, and much admired
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
article of dress, ten double threads are attached by one
end to a small <i>wang</i> or shred of leather, which is firmly
stretched and fixed transversely to the work; each double
thread is placed at such a distance from the adjoining
ones, as to give room for the beads. These are then
strung on, one upon each double thread; by this operation
a transverse row of beads is formed upon the work,
parallel to the <i>wang</i>; this being done, the left hand double
thread is passed to the right, not over and under, but
through all the other double threads, parallel to, and in
contact with the row of beads, and in this position occupies
the situation of woof or <i>filling</i>; but its extremity is continued
along on the right side of the work, so as to resume,
in that portion of its length, the character of warp or
<i>chain</i>. Another row of beads is now put on; after which
the next left hand double thread is passed through each
of the others to the right of the work, as the previous one
had been.</p>

<p>They also make handsome garters for supporting the
leggings below the knee, of the breadth of the hand;
they are formed of beads strung on worsted yarn.</p>

<p>{8} Their art of painting is very rude, yet they manage
to give some idea of a battle, by graphic representations
in colour, on a bison robe. In the same manner are
depicted the various animals, which are the objects of
their hunts. These robes are also decorated with blue,
red, and black broad lines, forming various designs;
indeed it is very common to see a robe thus ornamented,
worn by an Omawhaw.</p>

<p>The art of sculpture is also in its rudest state, and is
almost limited to the ornamenting of the war-club with
indented lines, forming different angular figures.</p>

<p>Their persons are often neatly tattooed in straight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
lines, and in angles on the breast, neck, and arms. The
daughters of chiefs, and those of wealthy Indians, generally
are denoted by a small round spot, tattooed on the forehead.
The process of tattooing is performed by persons,
who make it a business of profit. Their instrument consists
of three or four needles, tied to the truncated and
flattened end of a stick, in such an arrangement that the
points may form a straight line; the figure desired is
traced upon the skin, and some dissolved gunpowder, or
pulverized charcoal, is pricked in with this instrument,
agreeably to the figure. The operator must be well
paid, and hence it is not every one that can conveniently
sustain the expense of having this distinguishing mark
placed on the forehead of his children.</p>

<p>Their astronomical knowledge is very limited. They
distinguish the north star (Polaris), and are aware of its
being apparently stationary, while the others seem to
revolve. Venus is known by the name of <i>Me-ka-ka-tun-guh</i>,
or big star. The constellation of the seven stars
(Pleiades), is called <i>Tapa</i>, or deer's head. The constellation
of the great bear (Ursa major), is distinguished
by the term <i>Wa-ba-ha</i>, or car for transporting sick or
wounded {9} persons on a march. The galaxy is called
<i>Wahconda-o-jun-ga</i>, or the path of the Master of Life.
When the moon is eclipsed, they say <i>Me-om-bottsa</i>, or the
moon is dead; and when the sun is eclipsed, they say the
sun is dead. A comet they denominate <i>Me-ka-ka-nare</i>, or
blazing star; this name, at least, was given to the comet
of 1811; they regarded it as portending the death of
some great chief; and as it happened, one of the great
Pawnee chiefs did die the same year, which confirmed
them in their notion. The three stars of Orion's belt,
are called <i>Me-huh-se</i>, or the goose-foot.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p>Wangewaha, the Hard Heart, chief of the Ioways,
has made himself considerably acquainted with the
manners of the white people; he surprised Mr. Dougherty
one day by inquiring, if it is true that the earth revolves
round the sun; he was of course answered in the affirmative;
when a sarcastic Indian of a group sitting near,
was overheard to say in a low voice, that it was indeed a
pretty story to tell them, when any person could see the
sun rise there, pass along in that direction, and set there
(pointing with his finger to the apparent course of the
luminary).</p>

<p>The day is divided into morning, noon, evening, and
night; and respectively indicated by the words, <i>Cas-aht-te</i>,
<i>Me-o-kons-ka</i>, <i>Paz-za</i>, and <i>Hon-da</i>. Any particular
hour of the day is denoted by pointing to the apparent
place of the sun at the specified time. The years are
denoted by the number of winters, and the months by
lunations.</p>

<p>Their geographical knowledge of the country over
which they roam is remarkably exact. They know
intimately every river and creek in the vicinity of the
Missouri, from Grand river up to the Arickaree nation,
on the left side of the river, and as far down as the Osage
river on the right, and south as far as the Black Hills,
together with their courses and distances.</p>

<p>{10} Mr. Dougherty, accompanied with two or three
young Indians, arrived at an Omawhaw hunting encampment,
late in the evening, and, after inquiring at
several of the lodges, at length entered the one in which
he intended to remain. Being asked by which way he
had come, he pointed out, as he thought, the true direction;
at this his fellow travellers smiled, and told him he
was mistaken. He was not undeceived till he went out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
of the lodge to observe the direction they had indicated,
when he became satisfied of their correctness. They
had, however, been less frequently in that part of the
country than he had been; but they had, without doubt,
instinctively noted all the changes of the direction which
they had made in winding through the temporary village,
for they could not avail themselves of previous local
knowledge.</p>

<p>But although they are remarkably accurate in their
knowledge of the proper direction in which to travel, in
order to reach a given point, yet they are often lost during
foggy days, or during heavy snow storms.</p>

<p>Their culinary utensils are few in number, and simple
in kind. The original earthenware pots are now rarely
used by the nations on the lower part of the Missouri,
being substituted by brass kettles, which they procure
from the traders in exchange for their peltries. The
Pawnees, however, whose intercourse with the whites
has been less considerable than that of the nations bordering
more closely on the Missouri, still employ earthen
vessels, and yet continue the limited manufacture of
them. These vessels are not glazed, and resemble in
composition the antique fragments of Indian earthenware,
found in various parts of the United States; the mementos
of a numerous people, that have been destroyed by obscure
causes, as well as by the avaricious policy, and cruelly
unjust and barbarous encroachments of {11} a people,
professing the mild doctrines of "peace on earth and
good will to men."</p>

<p>Food is served up in wooden bowls, of a very wide and
simple form, and of various sizes, generally carved, with
much patient application, out of a large knot or protuberance
of the side of a tree. The spoon is made of bison
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
horn, and is of a large size; the handle, variously ornamented
by notching and other rude carving, is elevated
into an angle of fifty or sixty degrees with its bowl, which
is about three inches wide, by about five in length; a size
which, in civilised life, would be inadmissible.</p>

<p>The only implement of husbandry is the hoe; if they
have not an iron one, they substitute the scapula of a
bison, attached to a stick in such a manner as to present
the same form. The traders supply them with
axes of iron.</p>

<p>The weapons used in hunting are bows and arrows,
and guns. The bow is about four feet long, of a simple
form, composed of hickory, or hop-horn beam wood,
(ostrya virginica,) or bow-wood,(maclura aurantiaca of
Nuttall,) the latter being greatly preferred. The cord
is of twisted bison, or elk sinew. The hunting arrow
is generally made of arrow-wood, (viburnum,) about
two feet in length, of the usual cylindric form, and armed
with elongate-triangular spear-head, made of sheet iron,
of which the shoulders are rounded, instead of the ordinary
barbed form; it is firmly affixed to the shank by
deer sinew, and its flight is equalised by three half webs of
the feathers of a turkey, neatly secured near its base, in
the usual manner. The war arrow differs from that
used for hunting, in having a barbed spear-head, very
slightly attached to the wood, so that if it penetrate the
body of an enemy, it cannot be withdrawn without leaving
the point in the wound.</p>

<p>The arrows are contained in a quiver, which is slung
obliquely across the back, and which is generally made
of Cougar skin, with the tail of the {12} animal dangling
down from the upper extremity; attached to this quiver
is also a skin case for the bow, when not in use. To bend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
the bow requires the exertion of considerable force, dexterously
applied; for this purpose three fingers are placed
upon the string, whilst the thumb and index finger grasp
the base of the arrow, where it rests on the string; the
wrist is defended from the percussion of the string by a
guard of leather. The smooth bored gun is preferred
to the rifle, the latter being too heavy for their use. Those
called Mackinaw guns are greatly preferred to those
which they more commonly procure from our traders,
being far more substantial and serviceable.</p>

<p>They make use of no traps, excepting those for catching
beaver, which they obtain from the traders chiefly on
loan. The hooks which they use in fishing are bought
of the traders. They have no fishing nets.</p>

<p>We saw no other domestic animals in the Indian
villages than horses, mules, asses, and dogs. The first
are by no means elegantly formed, but they are hardy
and serviceable. The Indians are generally cruel horse
masters, perhaps in a great measure through necessity;
the backs of their horses are very often sore and ulcerated,
from the friction of the rude saddle, which is fashioned
after the Spanish manner, being elevated at the pummel
and croup, and resting on skin saddle cloths without
padding. They ride extremely well, and make great use
of the whip and the heel. The former is attached to the
wrist by a broad band, which passes through a hole
perforated near the end of the handle. The handle is
about fifteen inches long only, and very stout; that of
the whip of Hashea, the Oto warrior, is the section of a
gun-barrel. The lash is composed of two thongs of bison
skin, from one-fourth to half an inch wide. These are
alternately passed through small longitudinal slits cut
in each, and, when {13} finished, exhibit, on a cursory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
view, the appearance of a flat plait, thick, and longer than
the handle.</p>

<p>The dogs of the Konzas are generally of a mixed breed,
between our dogs with pendant ears, and the native dogs,
whose ears are universally erect; the Indians of this
nation seek every opportunity to cross the breed. These
mongrel dogs are less common with the Omawhaws;
while the dogs of the Pawnees generally have preserved
their original form.</p>

<p>No regular sentinels are appointed to watch during
the night; but many of the young men, who are moving
about the greater part of the night on their errands of
love, often singing and hallooing to excite the attention
of their mistresses, are the only guards of the safety of the
village from surprise. If, however, the nation have reason
to believe that the enemy is near at hand, or that there is
a probability of an attack, they are necessarily vigilant;
young warriors volunteer to look out at different points,
or are requested to do so by the chiefs.</p>

<p>Wars generally originate in the stealing of horses, and
the elopement of squaws; they are sometimes the consequence
of infringing on each other's hunting grounds.
Hostilities are generally conducted by small predatory
parties, which are originated and formed under the influence
of some approved warrior. An individual of
this description, having determined to endeavour to
assemble a war party, as a first step, paints himself over
with white clay; he then passes through the camp or
village, crying aloud to the Wahconda, and requesting
the young warriors of the nation to have pity on him,
and accompany him to strike at the enemy; he then
ascends some hill or elevation, or repairs to the woods,
and there continues for some time his ejaculations. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
following day he gives a feast to all such as are willing
to accompany him; and it is distinctly understood, that
all of those who partake of his hospitality on this occasion
are enlisted for the {14} excursion. He occasionally
repeats this crying and feasting, until a convenient period
can be assigned for their departure. During this interval
he also occupies himself in <i>making medicine</i>, hanging out
his medicine bags, &amp;c. At his feasts he harangues his
men, telling them that they must endeavour to make
themselves known to the nation by their warlike deeds.</p>

<p>This leader the French distinguish by the name of
<i>partizan</i>, and the Omawhaws <i>No-doh-hun-guh</i>; his
medicine parcel, upon which much reliance is placed,
for the successful termination of their adventure, contains,
almost always, the skin of a sparrow hawk (Falco sparverius),
and many small articles, such as wampum,
beads, and tobacco, all attached to a belt, but carefully
and neatly enveloped in bark, and tied around by strips
of the same material, forming a cylindrical figure, of
about twelve inches in length.</p>

<p>This is suspended upon the back or shoulders of the
partizan, by its belt, which passes round his neck.</p>

<p>Having their mockasins, leggings, guns, bows and
arrows, spears, war clubs, and scalping knives prepared,
each man furnishes himself with some provisions, and
they all depart silently during the night, led by the
partizan.</p>

<p>On their route towards the enemy they proceed with
great caution, and constantly send forward runners, or
spies, to reconnoitre. When encamped, some individuals
are vigilant during the night, but if they suppose themselves
to be distant from the enemy, they keep no watch.</p>

<p>The medicine bag is not permitted to touch the ground;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
accordingly on encamping, it is carefully suspended to a
forked stick, which is stuck firmly in the soil; the ceremony
of smoking to it, is then performed, the stem of the
pipe being occasionally directed towards it, the heavens
and the earth. After this ceremony, if the party is in the
vicinity of the {15} enemy, the partizan places the medicine
bag about the neck of one of his trusty warriors, and,
whispering in his ear, directs him to take two or three men,
and look carefully about for signs of the enemy.</p>

<p>On the return of this messenger the partizan runs to
meet him, receives his report in a whisper, takes the important
charge from his neck, and whilst returning it to
its place, communicates the intelligence he has received
to his party; "no sign of the enemy has yet been discovered,
but have patience, my brave young men, the
Wahconda will soon have pity on us, and show us the
enemy we so anxiously seek." If, on the contrary, the
enemy is discovered, his position and numbers are reconnoitred,
and the party prepares to attack them. The
sacred medicine bag is now opened by the partizan; the
envelop is rejected, and the remainder is suspended from
his neck, with the bird skin, wampum, &amp;c. hanging down
before from the belt. This is a signal, indicating that a
blow must be struck. The party then paint themselves,
and smoke if time admits of it. The partizan at length
gives the wished for order, and the whole move onward,
with slow and cautious steps, in order to surprise the
enemy; but if discovered, they rush on with impetuosity,
and without any regular order. If the scene of the contest
lies in the forest, they shield themselves behind trees
of small diameter, when at the proper distance, from
whence they discharge their missiles. If the attack is
made in the open plain, where no shelter offers, they leap
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
about from one side to another, and preserve a constant
state of activity, for the purpose of preventing any steady
aim from being taken at them by their adversaries.</p>

<p>It is not the mere shooting down of an enemy that
confers great honour upon a warrior; this, the Indians
say, can be done by any person, however cowardly he may
be. But high distinction is due to the gallant soul, that
advances upon the field of {16} battle, and captures an
enemy, or who first strikes, or even touches the body of a
fallen enemy, in presence of the friends of the deceased,
who are generally watching their opportunity to revenge
his death.</p>

<p>This is, indeed, an extraordinary proof of courage, as
the act is not to be accomplished without the greatest
hazard of life; the adventurer is obliged to expose himself,
often, to a great number of assailants, besides the
danger of falling into an ambush, in attempting to strike
the decoy. It is this <i>striking</i>, that is numbered amongst
their war feats by the warriors, at their dances.</p>

<p>The capture of a prisoner confers the highest honour
on the captor. Striking an enemy, whilst active, appears
to be the second in rank, of their great martial achievements.
Striking his dead, or disabled body, confers the
third honour. Capturing a horse may be regarded as
the fourth; presenting a horse to any person, the fifth,
and the shooting, or otherwise killing an enemy, by a
missile, is the sixth in point of rank of military deeds, in
the estimation of the Omawhaws. The taking of a
scalp is merely an evidence of what has been done, and,
of itself, seems to confer no honour.</p>

<p>The prisoners are well guarded, and not roughly
treated, unless a strong party of the enemy are in pursuit,
when they are put to death.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p>On the battle ground, the wounded of the vanquished
are killed, and their dead are cut and hacked by the
victors; but if it should chance to be accessible to the
squaws, they perform the chief part in this tragedy.
They sever the limbs from the bodies, and attaching
them to strings, drag them about with vociferous exultation:
etiam genitalia excidunt, and tying them about the
necks of their dogs, they drive them before them, with
much shouting, laughter, noise, and obscene expressions.</p>

<p>{17} A war party, after having struck a blow upon the
enemy, return with rapidity towards their village.</p>

<p>They leave the mutilated carcasses of the slain upon
the contested field, a prey to the wolves and vultures.
Their own dead are covered with wood or stones, and
their wounded are transported on litters, on the shoulders
of others, or if they have horses with them, upon cars of a
very simple construction. Two poles are attached to
the neck of the horse, in the manner of shafts, which
trail upon the ground behind. These are so connected
behind the horse, with cross pieces lashed on, that a
bison robe can be suspended to them, for the reception
of the wounded person.</p>

<p>If the attack is made during the night, or if the party
has only captured horses unobserved by the enemy, a
mockasin or arrow is left in a conspicuous situation, to
inform the enemy of the nation to which the aggressors
belong.</p>

<p>Large war parties sometimes divide into smaller parties,
in order to attack simultaneously at different points.
Each of these parties on its return, at its different
encampments, inserts small painted sticks in the soil,
pointing to the route they have taken. They also peel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
off a portion of the bark from a tree, and on the trunk
thus denuded and rendered conspicuous, they delineate
hieroglyphics with vermillion or charcoal, indicative of
the success or misfortune of the party in their proceedings
against the enemy. These hieroglyphics are rudely
drawn, but are sufficiently significant, to convey the
requisite intelligence to another division of the party that
may succeed them. On this rude chart, the combatants
are generally represented by small straight lines, each
surmounted by a head-like termination, and are readily
distinguishable from each other; the arms and legs are
also represented, when necessary to record the performance
of some particular act, or to exhibit a wound.
Wounds are indicated by the representation of the {18}
dropping of blood from the part; an arrow wound, by
adding a line for the arrow, from which the Indian is
able, to estimate with some accuracy, its direction, and
the depth to which it entered. The killed are represented
by prostrate lines; equestrians are also particularized,
and if wounded or killed, they are seen to spout blood,
or to be in the act of falling from their horses. Prisoners
are denoted by their being led, and the number of captured
horses is made known by the number of lunules,
representing their track. The number of guns taken may
be ascertained by bent lines, on the angle of which is
something like the prominences of the lock. Women are
portrayed with short petticoats and prominent breasts,
and unmarried females by the short queues at the ears,
before described.</p>

<p>A war party, on its return, generally halts upon some
elevated ground within sight of the village; and if they
have been successful, they sit down and smoke their
pipes. The villagers on discovering them rush out to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
meet them, and receive a brief relation of the events that
have occurred during the expedition.</p>

<p>All then return to the village, exhibiting by the way the
greatest demonstrations of joy, by discharging their guns,
singing war-songs, &amp;c. The scalps stretched upon hoops,
and dried, are carried upon rods of five or six feet in
length.</p>

<p>Arrived at the village, some of the squaws, wives to
the warriors of the party, assume the dress of their husbands,
and, with the rods bearing the scalps in their
hands, dance around a large post, reddened with vermillion,
and, in concert with the young warriors, sing the war and
scalp songs; the young warriors occasionally step into
the ring of the dancers, and all keep time, with dance and
song, to the loud beat of the gong. Into this dance are
also admitted the relatives of the war party.</p>

<p>This barbarous dance appears to delight them, {19}
and particularly the squaws, who are the principal actors,
more than almost any other of their enjoyments.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is to the squaws that many of these excursions
are attributable, as those whose husbands have not
been successful in war, frequently murmur, saying,
"You have had me for a wife a long time, and have never
yet gratified me with the scalp dance."</p>

<p>Those squaws, whose husbands or relatives have been
killed during the excursions of the party, take no part
in this blissful dance, but rub themselves with clay, and
lament.</p>

<p>This dance is repeated every night for two or three
weeks, after which it is renewed occasionally for a twelvemonth.
The scalps are often cut into slips, that many
of the dancers may be accommodated with them; but
this was never done with an intention to deceive, respecting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
the actual number of the enemy killed. After the termination
of this ceremony, the scalps are either thrown
away, or are used to decorate the leggings of the warrior,
or to suspend from his medicine-bag, or from the bridle
of his horse.</p>

<p>Soon after the return of the party, the principal warriors
are invited to feasts by different villagers, where they
recount the events that have transpired during their
absence. They narrate the mode of approaching the
enemy, the onset, the battle, all the little particulars of
which are detailed: but they seem to dwell with particular
pleasure on the conduct of individuals of the enemy, as
it appeared immediately before they received the death
blow; if there was any movement of the body, or emotion
exhibited upon the countenance of the victim, that
betrayed a want of firmness, or fear of death, at that
awful juncture, the account excites much laughter in the
audience. If the disabled individual was so imbecile
as to shrink from a blow of the tomahawk {20} or war-club,
he is ridiculed as a coward. If he is said to have cried
for quarter, or begged for mercy, or to have held up the
palm of his hand towards the victor to appease his vengeance,
the account is received with ridicule and laughter,
at the expense of the deceased. If, on the contrary, he
is said to have perished with that stoicism and contempt
of death, which is regarded as worthy of the Indian
warrior, the auditors, although they may smile with
pleasure at the death of an enemy, yet pay due honour to
his manes, saying he was a brave fellow; and they do not
fail to applaud the bravery of his victor also.</p>

<p>All those of the party who have first struck a body, or
taken a prisoner, paint themselves black, and if any
strangers are in the village, they put on their <i>crow</i>, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
appear before them, or near them, and sing their war-song
in which their exploits are detailed.</p>

<p>The prisoners are differently treated according to
their sex, age, and qualifications. Of the squaws they
make slaves, or rather servants, though these are sometimes
advantageously married. To the young men the
task of tending horses is commonly assigned; but the
children are generally adopted into their families, and
are treated in every respect as their own offspring; when
arrived at maturity they are identified with the nation,
and it would be an insult to apply the name of their own
countrymen to them.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV_II">{21} CHAPTER IV {II}</h2>

<p class="hang">War—Negociation for Peace—Revenge—Self-esteem—Hospitality—Mimicry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> individual warrior not unfrequently goes to war
unaccompanied; but parties are generally made up for
this purpose, in the manner before mentioned. In cases
of extraordinary provocation, the whole nation of warriors
marches in a body to attack the enemy, under the direction
of the principal chief.</p>

<p>More than twenty years ago, the Omawhaws marched
against the Pawnee Mahas or Pawnee Loups. They
encountered them on their hunting grounds, between the
Platte and Quicourre<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> rivers, in the prairie, where they
attacked them, killed sixty, and wounded a great many;
after securing a number of prisoners, and many horses,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
they returned with their booty, having lost but fifteen
warriors. Peace was soon after concluded between the
two nations, which has not been since violated, excepting
on one occasion, when their dispute was bloodless,
and of but short duration.</p>

<p>Sometime after this event, Mot-tschu-jinga, or the
Little Grizzly Bear, a brave and distinguished warrior
of the nation, with two or three attendants, visited the
village of the Pawnee republicans, in order to perform
the calumet dance before the people. This was a band
with whom they were barely at peace. The republicans
seized him, flogged him, cut off his hair, broke his pipe,
forced him to drink urine mixed with bison gall, and
drove him from the village without food. These extraordinary
and most humiliating indignities aroused within
him the fiercest spirit of vengeance. He returned, and
related his misfortune {22} to his people, who, penetrated
with indignation, promptly assembled in arms, and led
by the great Washingguhsahba, or Black Bird, marched
to revenge such unheard-of indignity. When within
a short distance of the devoted village, they placed their
squaws in a secure situation, under a proper guard, and
proceeded to the attack. They urged the contest so
fiercely that the enemy was driven from lodge to lodge,
until four lodges only were left to them, in which they
succeeded in defending themselves; the town, with the
exception only of the four lodges, was then burned to the
ground, and the victors retired after destroying nearly
one hundred of the enemy, and wounding a great number,
with the loss to themselves of only fifteen warriors.</p>

<p>Under the same great leader, the nation, on another
occasion, attacked the Puncaws; this act was induced
by the practice of the latter of stealing squaws and horses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
from the Omawhaws. The Puncaws, for the purpose of
defending themselves against the fire of the enemy, threw
up an earthen embankment; but finding, notwithstanding
the protection it afforded them, that their numbers
rapidly diminished under the galling fire opposed to
them, they determined to sue for peace; for this purpose
two pipe-bearers were sent out successively towards the
enemy, but they were both shot down. A chief then
dressed up his handsome daughter, and sent her forth
with a pipe to the Omawhaws. This mission was respected,
the stern victors were vanquished by beauty, the
proffered pipe was accepted, and unhesitatingly smoked,
and a peace was concluded, which has not since been
infracted by the Omawhaws. Soon after the death of
Washingguhsahba, his successor Mushchinga, the Big
Rabbit, led the nation against the Otoes, whom they
attacked in their village. It was the intention of the
assailants to burn the village, and exterminate the nation.
With this view they provided themselves with dry grass,
which was twisted into the form of thick ropes, {23} and
secured to their girdles. When within the proper distance
they despatched a detachment to take ambush on
the opposite side of the village, then kindled a fire, at
which they lighted the grass torches, and rushing into
the village, succeeded in setting many of the lodges on
fire, by fixing the torches to them. Such was the fury
of the unexpected attack, that the Oto warriors were
driven from the village, but falling into the ambuscade,
they fought their way back to their lodges with much
slaughter. A heavy fall of rain now commenced, which
rescued the remaining Otoes from entire destruction.
The conflagration was quickly extinguished, the guns and
bow-strings of the invaders became useless, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
Otoes sallying out with fresh weapons, forced them to a
precipitate retreat. The loss was severe on both sides,
but the Omawhaws succeeded in carrying off almost all
the horses of the enemy, besides a number of prisoners,
furniture, &amp;c. The war continued between these two
nations until the pacification which was accomplished
through the agency of Lewis and Clark, and has continued
to the present day.</p>

<p>Reverting to the period of the government of Washingguhsahba,
we are informed that the Padoucas once
approached the nation, and stole a number of horses, when
this chief assembled his warriors, and pursued them;
observing the tracks of their feet in the soft earth, he
discharged his gun repeatedly into them, declaring that
thereby he would cripple the fugitives so entirely, that
it would be easy to overtake and destroy them. Accordingly
he did overtake them, and, agreeably to the Indian
account, they were unable to defend themselves, and
were all destroyed but two or three, who escaped, and
failed not to inform their people of the wonderful medicine
of the victor.</p>

<p>The last martial expedition of Washingguhsahba,
terminated disastrously for his nation. He led his
warriors against the Konzas, halted them near the {24}
village of that people, and singly rode round the village,
repeatedly discharging his gun at the inhabitants, as he
passed swiftly by them. As soon as the Konza warriors
were collected, they sallied out in pursuit of the Black
Bird, who had now joined his party. The parties closed,
and intermingled in fight, and the contest was obstinate and
protracted. An Omawhaw pierced the thigh of a Konza
with an arrow; the latter called aloud to inquire the
name of his adversary, and was answered, No-zun-doj-je
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
(he who does not dodge). "My name," said the Konza,
"is —— (he who kills brave men), so come on, we are
happily met." They approached each other, leaping
laterally and capering, the Omawhaw discharging his
arrows, and the Konza endeavouring to get aim with
his fusee; the latter at length succeeded, and shot his
opponent.</p>

<p>The conflict at length became too warm for the Omawhaws,
who retreated eight miles, disputing the ground,
however, the whole distance. They now arrived at the
prairie, on which we encamped on the evening of the 24th
of August last.</p>

<p>Here the Omawhaws again made a stand, and fought
the principal battle, but were overpowered, and obliged
to fly, leaving their numerous killed and wounded to the
vengeance of the enemy.</p>

<p>These two nations still continue hostile to each other.</p>

<p>It is said that during the youth of Washingguhsahba,
he was taken prisoner by the Sioux. That the town of the
Omawhaws, was then on the opposite bank of the Missouri,
at the mouth of the stream called by Lewis and
Clark, Floyd's river,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> and that the nation had not, at that
time, been long resident there.</p>

<p>Some time previous to the variolous mortality in the
Omawhaw nation, several bands of Sioux, in conjunction
with the Shienne nation,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> attacked them on their return
from a summer hunt, and overpowered them by numbers.</p>

<p>{25} A few years since, the Pawnees made a general
attack upon the Konza village. They were all mounted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
on horseback, and rode furiously about, whilst they fired
into the Konza lodges. The principal chief of the nation,
Burning Heart, ran through his village, calling out to his
warriors to remain quietly in their houses for the present,
and not show themselves to the enemy, or return their
fire, in order to give them time to tire out their horses by
continued action. After a while a few shots were returned,
to prevent the Pawnees from rushing into the town itself,
and when the horses appeared to be sufficiently fatigued,
Burning Heart despatched two strong parties from the
opposite end of the village from that upon which the attack
was made, one of which, moving rapidly upon their
hands and knees, gained a ravine, along which they ran
until they gained the enemy's rear: they were here joined
by the other party, which had gained the same situation
by means of a lower prairie, along the bank of which they
passed unperceived. Finding themselves thus out-generaled,
the Pawnees were under the necessity of charging
through the enemy, and flying with jaded horses before
them. So rapid was the pursuit, that the Pawnees were
obliged to precipitate themselves into the ravines, over
which they must pass, to the destruction of many of their
horses. Finally, they made their escape, with the loss of
eighty men, and the greater part of their horses.</p>

<p>When a hunting party is suddenly attacked by an enemy,
the squaws, whilst their husbands are engaged in opposing
the enemy, sedulously occupy themselves in digging basin-shaped
pits with their hoes, for their personal security, and
stooping down in them, escape the missiles of the contending
parties; their husbands, if too hard pressed, also retreat
to these cavities, from which they can continue the
action with very little exposure of their own persons, whilst
the enemy possesses no shelter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p>{26} Besides the national battles, in which great waste
of life occurs, small war parties, or such as have been
already described, are almost constantly in motion, and
are also destructive.</p>

<p>The Serpent's Head, a distinguished Oto warrior, assembled
a war party of thirty men, and moved against the
Konzas. Within a few miles of their village, at a narrow
defile on Blue-earth Creek, he placed his party in ambush,
and with two or three selected men, he advanced to within
a hundred yards of the village. At the dawn of day a
Konza, having occasion to walk a short distance, was attacked
by the Serpent's Head singly, who buried his tomahawk
in his head, and took off his scalp, within view of
many of the villagers. These seized their weapons, and
immediately pursued the fugitives, until they reached
the pass, where, falling into the ambuscade prepared for
their reception, they lost seven of their number, and were
obliged to retreat precipitately, to seek the protection of
the main body of their warriors, who, they supposed, were
now in pursuit, and at no great distance in the rear.</p>

<p>The Otoes, after striking and scalping the slain, proceeded
on their way home, at a very moderate pace, not
caring to elude the powerful force, which they well knew
must be hard by. The Konza warriors, dashing on at full
speed, at length discovered the retreating band, moving at
their leisure over a prairie, and immediately attacked them.
The Otoes withstood the shock of the overwhelming force
for some time, until, losing a number of their party, they
were under the necessity of seeking safety in flight.</p>

<p>An Oto hunting party, consisting of five lodges, was encamped
in the vicinity of the Konza hunting grounds; two
or three of their number, who were at a distance from their
companions, encountered a young Konza warrior, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
deliberately approached {27} them, and when sufficiently
near discharged his gun at them, but was immediately shot
down.</p>

<p>The Otoes suspecting, from some appearances, the
proximity of a large body of the enemy, precipitately returned
to their party, and hastened to place themselves
in an attitude of defence. They availed themselves of
three large logs, which had fallen so as to form a triangular
area, into which they removed their effects, and strengthened
the defences in such a manner as to afford them
some security.</p>

<p>The squaws dug cavities in the earth for themselves,
and their children, as an additional security.</p>

<p>Scarcely were these preparations finished, when the
whole body of the Konza warriors made their appearance,
and commenced the attack on this little body of fifteen
Otoes. These gallant fellows, thus advantageously posted,
notwithstanding the fearful odds opposed to them, returned
the fire of the enemy promptly, and at length succeeded in
repulsing them, with the loss of two or three of their own
men, and after having killed about fifteen of the Konzas.</p>

<p>The following trait in the character of a distinguished
warrior is worthy of being recorded. During the residence
of the Pawnees on the Platte at the cedar hills, about fifteen
or eighteen years since, the Otoes were frequently at war
with them, notwithstanding their own great numerical
inferiority. On one occasion, during a pacific interval,
some Otoes followed the Pawnees, who had just left their
village on a national hunt, and stole two horses from them.
This outrage, committed in time of peace, highly incensed
Wasacaruja: "If you wish for war," said he to the offenders,
as he mounted his horse, "you shall have it." He
rode immediately, in his anger, to the deserted Pawnee
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
village, and setting fire to the lodges, burned them all to
the ground.</p>

<p>On their return, the Pawnees, finding their village
destroyed, they marched in a body to the Otoes, {28} and
demanded satisfaction for the injury they had received.
Wasacaruja, perhaps, penitent for his rash act, and no
doubt now wishing to avert the hostilities which he had incited,
advanced to them at once, saying "I am the person
who burned your town, kill me if you will." This however
the Pawnees declined, and were at length reconciled to their
loss, by presents of horses and merchandize. They then
removed from the vicinity of the Otoes, and erected their
present village on the Loup fork of the Platte.</p>

<p>The Otoes, as well as the Konza warriors, will not, on
any consideration, sit down whilst on a war excursion,
until evening; they will lie down, and stoop down, but
they must not rest upon the ground in a sitting posture.</p>

<p>An Upsaroka, or Crow, war party, who were hovering
about the Rickaree village, waiting an opportunity to strike
a blow, observed a boy entirely alone, and at a distance
from any succour; having a boy belonging to the party
much of the same size, they permitted him to attack the
Rickaree boy singly; the assailant was successful, and
brought off the scalp of the enemy.</p>

<p>One of the warriors then took the scalp, and rode with
it near to the village in defiance.</p>

<p>During the last seven or eight years, since they have
become influenced by the agents of the United States, the
Omawhaws have entirely abstained from carrying the war
into the country of their enemies; no unprovoked parties
have been sent out, and the nation, agreeably to the injunctions
of the agents, restricts its military operations
solely to defensive warfare. Partial attacks have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
made upon them during this time, which have always been
promptly repelled, sometimes with considerable slaughter.</p>

<p>That implicit confidence may be justly reposed upon,
at least, some of this people, the following anecdote will
testify.</p>

<p>{29} In the year 1815 the Ioways came to the mouth of
the Platte river, and found there a trader engaged in
trafficking with the Otoes. They attempted to take possession
of his merchandize by force, but were opposed and
repelled by the Otoes, who determined to protect their
trader. The Ioways, however, threatened the trader to
plunder him as soon as the Otoes should depart, whose
provisions being now nearly exhausted, the fears of the
trader for his safety became more excited, in proportion
as the time of their departure approached. He despatched
a boy with a letter to his partner, Mr. Lisa, then trading
at Council Bluff, a distance of thirty miles, informing him
of his situation, and of the fact, which had but then come
to his knowledge, that the Ioways had formed a small party
for the purpose of visiting Council Bluff, and committing
some depredations there.</p>

<p>On the reception of this intelligence, Mr. Lisa sent a
favourite Omawhaw, Wa-co-ra, to accompany the boy
with his reply.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Ioway party had set out, and after
travelling a considerable distance, the partizan became
lame, and was left with a companion on the way.</p>

<p>Wacora, fortunately, did not meet the party, but he saw
the partizan with his companion, calmly seated in fancied
security, amongst the thick bushes. He crept silently near
to them, who were distinctly recognized by the boy, and
discharging his gun, broke the arm of the partizan's companion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<p>The partizan immediately perceiving the aggressor to be
an Omawhaw, exclaimed, "I am a half Omawhaw; I was
going to war against the Long-knives, not against the
Omawhaws; shoot no more, you have wounded one of us."
Wacora answered, "I am a Long-knife," upon which the
wounded man made a charge with a lance, and had nearly
transfixed the boy, when Wacora shot him; he  {30} afterwards
killed the partizan, and bore off their scalps. Finding
now the trail of the party, which he readily ascertained
by their tracks, to consist of nine persons, he determined to
return immediately with his utmost speed, even at the risk
of meeting with the party, in order to inform Mr. Lisa of
their presence in his vicinity; this he accomplished at the
imminent hazard of his life. Thus proving that the most
unlimited confidence might be safely reposed in his faithful
performance of his trusts.</p>

<p>Warriors often venture singly into the vicinity of an
enemy's village, and even into the village itself, to capture
horses or kill one of the nation. The Borgne, or One Eye,
Ka-ko-a-kis, late grand chief of the Minnetarees, entered
the village of an enemy at night, with his robe covering
his head for concealment. He passed into several lodges,
until at length he found one tenanted, at the moment, only
by a young squaw; he drew his knife, compelled her to
submit to his desires, then stabbed her to the heart, and
bore off her scalp. He was a chief possessed of much
power, but was almost universally disliked as a very bad
man, and was at length killed by the Red-shield chief,
E-tam-ina-geh-iss-sha.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>The warriors often meet together and narrate, emulously,
their war exploits; two of them were one day thus engaged,
one of whom, Wa-ke-da, or the Shooter, had killed more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
enemies than any other individual of his nation, although
he had never <i>struck</i> more than two or three bodies of the
slain. They continued for some time to boast of their feats,
when the father of Wakeda, an old man of seventy years,
in order to terminate the altercation, leaped from his seat,
and, after <i>striking</i> upon several nations, concluded by the
following witticism: "I approached the Pawnee-mahaws
alone, for the purpose of stealing horses. I entered their
village in the evening, succeeded in getting into one of
their stalls, and was proceeding to take out the horses,
when I was surrounded {31} and made prisoner. They
flogged me, thrust a stick into my anus, and sent me off,
with the stick depending like a tail." This, as was intended,
terminated the boasting, and the parties joined in general
good humour.</p>

<p>Their notions of the attributes of bravery differ in many
respects from those which we entertain of them. It is,
in their estimation, no proof either of valour or good sense,
for a warrior to advance into the plain, stand still, and suffer
his enemy to take deliberate aim, in order to shoot him
down, when such a course of conduct can be avoided; but
they say that when a warrior goes to battle, it is a duty,
which is due to himself, to his nation, and to his friends,
to avail himself of every possible advantage over his enemy,
and even to kill him, if he can, without any risk of his own
person. But a warrior must never yield in battle; he must
contend until death, if he cannot escape from his enemy.
And if entirely surrounded, he rushes amongst them, and
endeavours to destroy or injure as many as possible, and
in death he exhibits traits of passive courage, which form
no part of the character of civilized men.</p>

<p>The succeeding narrative may serve, better than any
general remarks, to convey an idea of the formalities attendant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
on a negociation for peace, amongst the Missouri
Indians.</p>

<p>During the stay of our detached party at the Konza
village, several chief men of the nation requested Mr.
Dougherty to lead a pacific deputation from their nation,
to their enemies the Otoes, Missouries, and Ioways, then
dwelling in one village on the Platte. Circumstances then
prevented the gratification of their wishes, but he gave
them to understand, that if the deputation would meet our
party near Council Bluff, he would probably then be authorized
to bear them company; on which they determined
to send a party thither. Accordingly, on {32} the day preceding
the arrival of our steam-boat at the position chosen
for our winter cantonment, a deputation from the Konzas
arrived for that purpose. It consisted of six men, led by
He-roch-che, or the Real War Eagle, one of the principal
warriors of the Konza nation.</p>

<p>Mr. Dougherty having made their pacific mission known
to Major O'Fallon, the latter expressed to them his cordial
approbation of their intentions, and the following day he
despatched Mr. Dougherty with them, to protect them by
his presence, on their approach to the enemy, and to assist
them by his mediation, in their negociations, should it be
found necessary.</p>

<p>They had not proceeded far on the way, when one of the
Indians inquired if the Sioux war parties were often in the
neighbourhood. Mr. Dougherty informed them that they
were; that they had killed an Oto some time since, and
more recently, four Omawhaw squaws. This intelligence
induced Herochshe to request the loan of Mr. Dougherty's
gun; they all looked sharply about them, and requested
their guide to take the lead.</p>

<p>The distance to the Oto village is about twenty-five
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
miles; on the journey over the prairies, they espied an
object at a distance, which was mistaken for a man, standing
upon an eminence. The Indians immediately halted,
when Herochshe addressed them, with the assurance that
they must put their trust in the Master of life, and in their
leader; and observed, that, having journeyed thus far on
their business, they must not return until their purpose was
accomplished; that if it was their lot to die, no event could
save them; "We have set out my braves,"<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> said he, "to
eat of the Otoes' victuals, and we must do so or die;" the
party then proceeded {33} onward. The Indians are
always very cautious when approaching an enemy's village,
on any occasion, and this party well knew that their
enterprize was full of danger.</p>

<p>In a short time they were again brought to a halt, by the
appearance of a considerable number of men and horses,
that were advancing towards them. After some consultation
and reconnoitring, they sat down upon the ground,
and lighting the peace-pipe, or calumet, Herochshe directed
the stem of it towards the objects of their suspicion,
saying, "smoke friend or foe;" he then directed it towards
the Oto village, towards the white people, towards heaven,
and the earth, successively.</p>

<p>The strangers, however, proved to be drovers, with cattle
for the troops, on their way to Council Bluff.</p>

<p>In consequence of being thus detained, it was late in the
afternoon when the party arrived at the Platte river, and
as they had still eight miles to travel, and it was indispensable
to their safety that they should reach the village before
dark, Mr. Dougherty urged his horse rapidly forwards.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
The Indians, who were all on foot, ran the whole distance,
halting but twice, in order to cross the Elk Horn and Platte
rivers, although one of them was upwards of sixty years of
age, and three of the others were much advanced in years.</p>

<p>As they drew near the Oto village, they were discovered
by some boys, who were collecting their horses together
for the night, and who, in a telegraphic manner, communicated
intelligence of their approach, to the people of
the village, by throwing their robes into the air.</p>

<p>The party was soon surrounded by the inhabitants,
who rushed towards them, riding and running with the
greatest impetuosity. The greatest confusion reigned for
some time, the Otoes shouting, hallooing, and screaming,
whilst their Konza visitors lamented aloud. Shaumonekusse
soon arrived, and restored a {34} degree of order,
when, the business of the mission being made known in a
few words, the Konzas were taken up behind some of the
horsemen, and conveyed as rapidly as possible to the lodge
of Shongotongo, lest personal violence should be offered
them on the way. They did not, however, escape the
audible maledictions of the squaws as they passed, but
were stigmatized as wrinkled-faced old men, with hairy
chins, &amp;c., ugly faces, and flat noses.</p>

<p>After running this species of gauntlet, they were quietly
seated in the lodge, where they were sure of protection.
A squaw, however, whose husband had been recently killed
by the Konzas, rushed into the lodge, with the intention of
seeking vengeance by killing one of the ambassadors on the
spot. She stood suddenly before Herochshe, and seemed
a very demon of fury. She caught his eye, and at the instant,
with all her strength, she aimed a blow at his breast
with a large knife, which was firmly grasped in her right
hand, and which she seemed confident of sheathing in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
heart. At that truly hopeless moment, the countenance
of the warrior remained unchanged, and even exhibited
no emotion whatever; and when the knife approached its
destination, with the swiftness of lightning, his eyes stood
firm, nor were its lids seen to quiver; so far from recoiling,
or raising his arm to avert the blow, that he even rather
protruded his breast, to meet that death which seemed inevitable,
and which was only averted by the sudden interposition
of the arm of one of her nation, that received the
weapon to its very bone.</p>

<p>Thus foiled in her attempt, the squaw was gently led out
of the lodge, and no one offered her violence, or even harsh
reproof. No further notice was taken of this transaction
by either party.</p>

<p>Food was then, as usual, placed before the strangers,
and soon after a warrior entered with a pipe, which he held
whilst Herochshe smoked, saying in a loud voice, "you tell
us that you wish for peace, I say, I {35} will give you a
horse, let us see which will be the liar, you or I." The
horse was presented to him.</p>

<p>The evening, and much of the night was passed in
friendly conversation respecting the events of the five years'
war which they had waged with each other.</p>

<p>On the following morning the Konzas were called to
partake of the hospitality of different lodges, whilst the
principal men of the village were assembled in council, to
deliberate upon the subject of concluding a peace.</p>

<p>At noon the joint and grand council was held in the
Crenier's lodge. The Otoes, Missouries, and Ioways took
their seats around the apartment, with the Konzas in the
centre. Herochshe, whose business it was first to speak,
holding the bowl of the calumet in his hand, remained
immovable for the space of three-fourths of an hour, when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
he arose, pointed the stem of the calumet towards each of
the three nations successively, then towards heaven, and
the earth, after which he stretched out his arm, with the
palm of the hand towards the members of the council,
moving round with his body so as to present the palm
towards each of the members in succession. He then
proceeded to shake each individual by the hand, after
which he returned to his place, and renewed the motion
of the hand as before.</p>

<p>Having performed all these introductory formalities,
he stood firm and erect, though perfectly easy and unconstrained,
and with a bold expression of countenance, loud
voice, and emphatical gesticulation, he thus addressed the
council.</p>

<p>"Fathers, brothers, chiefs, warriors, and brave men.
You are all great men. I am a poor obscure individual.
It has, however, become my duty to inform you, that the
chiefs and warriors of my nation, sometime ago, held a
council for the purpose of concerting measures, to terminate
amicably, the cruel and unwelcome war, that has so
long existed between us, and chose me, all insignificant as
I am, to {36} bring to you this pipe which I hold in my
hand. I have visited your village, that we might all smoke
from the same pipe, and eat from the same bowl, with the
same spoon, in token of our future union in friendship.</p>

<p>"On approaching your village, my friends and relatives,
I thought I had not long to live. I expected that you
would kill me, and these poor men who have followed me.
But I received encouragement from the reflection, that if
it should be my fate to die to-day, I would not have to die
to-morrow, and I relied firmly upon the Master of life.</p>

<p>"Nor was this anticipation of death unwarranted by
precedent. You may recollect that five winters ago, six
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
warriors of my nation came to you, as I have now done,
and that you killed them all, but one, who had the good
fortune to escape. This circumstance was vivid in my
memory when I yesterday viewed your village in the distance;
said I, those warriors who preceded me in the attempt
to accomplish this desirable object, although they
were greater and more brave than I, yet were they killed by
those whom they came to conciliate, and why shall not I
share their fate; if so, my bones will bleach near theirs.
If, on the contrary, I should escape death, I will visit the
bones of my friends. The oldest of my followers here,
was father-in-law to the chief of those slaughtered messengers;
he is poor and infirm, and has followed me with
difficulty; his relatives, also, are poor, and have been long
lamenting the loss of the chief you killed. I hope you will
have pity on him, and give him a pair of mockasins (meaning
a horse) to return home with, for he cannot walk.
Two or three others of my companions are also in want
of mockasins for their journey homeward.</p>

<p>"My friends! we wish for peace, and we are tired of
war; there is a large tract of country, intervening between
us, from which, as it is so constantly {37} traversed by our
respective hostile parties, we cannot either of us kill the
game in security, to furnish our traders with peltries. I
wish to see a large level road over that country, connecting
our villages together, near which no one can conceal himself
in order to kill passengers, and that our squaws may be
enabled to visit from village to village in safety, and not
be urged by fear, to cast off their packs, and betake themselves
to the thickets, when they see any person on the
route. Our nations have made peace frequently, but a
peace has not hitherto been of long duration. I hope,
however, that which we shall now establish will continue
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
one day, two days, three days, four days, five days. My
friends! what I have told you is true; I was not sent here
to tell you lies. That is all I have to say."</p>

<p>Herochshe then lit his pipe, and presented the stem to
the brother of the Crenier, Wa-sac-a-ru-ja, or He who eats
raw, who had formerly been his intimate friend. The
latter held the end of the stem in his hand, whilst he looked
Herochshe full in the face, for a considerable space of time.
At length he most emphatically asked, "Is all true that
you have spoken." The other, striking himself repeatedly
and forcibly upon the breast, answered with a loud voice,
"Yes! It is all truth that I have spoken." Wasacaruja,
without any further hesitation, accepted the proffered
pipe, and smoked, whilst Herochshe courteously held the
bowl of it in his hand; the latter warrior then held it
in succession to each member of the council, who respectively
took a whiff or two, after which the pipe itself
was presented to Wasacaruja to retain.</p>

<p>It is impossible to convey an adequate idea of the energy,
and propriety, with which this speech was delivered, or of
the dignity and self-possession of the speaker. Before he
commenced, he hesitated and looked around upon his
enemies, probably in order to trace in the lineaments of
their countenances, the {38} expression of their feelings
towards him. He then began his address, by raising his
voice at once to its full intonation, producing a truly powerful
effect upon the ear, by a contrast with the deep and
long continued silence which preceded it. He was at no
loss for subject or for words, but proceeded right onwards
to the close of his speech, like a full-flowing, bold, and
impetuous stream.</p>

<p>Wasacaruja, in consequence of having first accepted of
the calumet, was now regarded as responsible for the sincerity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
of his friend Herochshe. He therefore arose, and
thus addressed the ambassador. "My friend! I am glad
to see you on such an occasion as the present, and to hear
that your voice is for peace. But I can hardly believe that
we can ever rest in a permanent peace. A few winters ago,
when we were in friendship with each other, I visited your
village, and you gave me all your people, saying, that all
the Konzas were mine. But it was not long afterwards,
as we hunted near your country, that you stole our horses
and killed some of our people, and I cannot but believe that
the same course will be again pursued. Nevertheless, I
shall again repair to the same place, of which I have spoken,
this autumn, for the purpose of hunting, and in the spring
I will again visit your town. You observed that you were
apprehensive of being killed as you approached our village;
and you most probably would have been so, coming as you
did, late in the evening, and without the usual formality
of sending a messenger to apprize us of your approach, had
you not been accompanied by the Big-knife with whom you
are so well acquainted. But we have now smoked together,
and I hope that the peace thus established, may long
continue. You say that you are in want of mockasins, we
will endeavour to give you one or two for your journey
home. That is all I have to say."</p>

<p>Herochshe then apologized for his unceremonious {39}
entrance into the village, by saying that he knew it to be
customary, to send forward a runner on such an occasion,
and he should have done so, but his friend, the Big-knife,
whom he had previously consulted with that view, told
him, that he had full confidence in the magnanimity
of the Otoes.</p>

<p>Thus the ceremony was concluded, and peace restored
between the two nations.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<p>Numerous are the anecdotes already related by various
authors, which go to show, that the desire of revenge for an
injury or insult is remarkably permanent with the North
American Indian. It would almost seem, that neither
time nor circumstance can utterly eradicate it, and it is
certain that it is not always extinguished with the life of
the offended individual, but that it sometimes descends
as an inheritance to his posterity.</p>

<p>A Puncaw warrior was killed in a quarrel, over the carcass
of a bison, by a noted desperado of his own nation.
The deceased left two sons, the elder of whom, in the
course of a few years, became of sufficient age to hunt, and
had the good fortune, in his first essay, to kill a fine bison.
Whilst he was occupied in taking off the skin from his prey,
he espied the murderer of his father approaching, who
took his stand near the young hunter, and regarded him
with a stern aspect. "Look up," said the intruder; the
young man proceeded with his occupation. "I say, look
at me;" reiterated the other, "do you know who I am?
begone from this carcass, it is mine." The young hunter
then raised his eyes to the countenance of him, whom he
had long been taught to consider as his enemy, and fiercely
retorted the dark malignant scowl which was concentrated
there; then gathering his bow and arrows, he slowly retired
a short distance, and turning, perceived that the
warrior had already taken possession of his prize. "Yes,"
he exclaimed, bending his bow, "I do know you well; you
are the murderer of my {40} father, and are the cause of
my being an orphan." As he spoke, he discharged an
arrow, which pierced the heart of his enemy, who fell dead;
the victor, however, continued to feather his body with
arrows, until his quiver was exhausted. He then returned
to the village and related his story to the people, who rejoiced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
at the death of a common disturber of the peace,
and no one was found who wished to revenge his death.</p>

<p>Vengeance is sometimes transferred from an immediate
to a remote object. The Otoes being on one occasion
encamped near Mr. Lisa's trading establishment, many
of their number became intoxicated with whiskey, and
troublesome to the traders. But in order that the latter
might not receive personal injury, two warriors were appointed
by the chiefs to stand guard at the door of the
house, with orders to repel all drunken individuals. Having
consumed all the whiskey that had been given them,
they clamorously demanded more, but the trader persisted
in refusing it to them. Incensed at this denial, the grand
chief Shongatonga, who was himself slightly intoxicated,
went into the house, and meeting one of the traders near
the door, he gave him a slight push with his hand, unobserved
by Hashea, the Cut-nose, who was then on guard.
The act, however, was perceived by an Indian who reclined
against an outhouse, at a little distance, smoking his pipe.
He advanced, apparently with perfect indifference, and
taking up a keg, the only weapon which presented, he
approached Shongatonga, and discharged it with all his
strength, full upon the head of that chief, who was knocked
down senseless by the violence of the blow.</p>

<p>The Little Soldier, a brother-in-law of Shongatonga,
who was present at this assault, immediately seized his
tomahawk, and making a threat, rushed out of the house,
his silver armbands and other ornaments, with which he
is usually profusely decorated, {41} sounding as he passed;
he halted for an instant at the door, in order to distinguish
some object on which to wreak his vengeance; espying
amongst the crowd of Otoes, one from whom he had received
an injury fifteen years before, which deprived him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
of the sight of one eye, he pursued him, and with a blow
of his tomahawk brought him to the ground; this unfortunate
individual, like his victor, had also lost an eye,
and in this rencontre the remaining one was destroyed.</p>

<p>Hashea, the guard, observing that the Indians were becoming
very disorderly, drew his knife, declaring that he
would kill the first individual of them he could meet with,
and pursuing the canaille, they fled in every direction.
During this interval an inferior Indian entered the store,
and pointing with his finger near to the face of Mr. Lisa,
said in a threatening tone, "You are the cause of all this
disturbance;" the latter immediately kicked him out of the
house; on which the Indian in a rage, declared he would
revenge himself for an injury so gross. Seeking some
object to destroy, he encountered a sow and pigs, and appeased
his rage by putting them all to death. The Little
Soldier now returned, and found that his relative had recovered.
Order was at length restored by the mediation
of Mr. Dougherty.</p>

<p>But instances are not rare, in which an Indian is unwilling
to punish an injury inflicted on himself, even when
retaliation is amply in his power. As the troops were
ascending the river, as usual, by the aid of the cordelle,
several Oto Indians were sitting on the river bank at the
establishment of the Missouri fur company, quietly smoking
their pipes, and apparently much interested in the
movements before them. One of them was accosted by
a soldier, who had left his cordelle for the purpose, with
an offer to purchase the pipe he was then using; but the
Indian would not part with it, saying, he had no other to
bear him company in his hunting excursions. {42} The
soldier requested permission to examine it, but as soon as
the Indian put the pipe into his hands, he twisted the bowl
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
from the handle and ran off with it. The Indian in company
with one of the traders, immediately pursued the
thief to his boat, and demanded the pipe; but obtaining
no satisfaction, he came to Engineer Cantonment, and
stated the circumstance to Major O'Fallon, who assured
him that his influence should not be wanting to procure
the pipe again, and to have the offender punished by a
very severe whipping. The Indian, however, with more
mercy than justice, replied, that he would extremely regret
the infliction of any punishment whatever upon the soldier,
and he desired it might not be done; all he wished for was
the recovery of his property.</p>

<p>The Omawhaws consider themselves superior, in the
scale of beings, to all other animals, and appear to regard
them as having been formed for their benefit. They will
sometimes say, when speaking of a bad person, "he is no
better than a brute." It is true that a magician tells his
auditors that "a grizzly bear whispered in my ear, and
gave me this medicine:" but his meaning is that the Wahconda,
in the shape of that animal, had communicated with
him.</p>

<p>Neither do they seem to suppose that the inferior animals
accompany them to the other world, though they
expect to pursue their occupation of hunting there.</p>

<p>In their opinion, the Wahconda has been more profuse
in his distribution of gifts to the white people, than to the
red-skins; particularly in imparting to us the knowledge
of letters, whereby the result of experience is so readily
transmitted from one person to another, so as to seem like
the operation of some great mystic medicine.</p>

<p>But they claim a superiority in natural intelligence, and
readily perceive that they are more {43} active, have a
greater capacity for undergoing, with fortitude, the many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
evils to which they are subject in every situation and season,
such as exposure to great heat and cold, hunger,
thirst, and pain. They appear to esteem themselves more
brave, more generous and hospitable to strangers than the
white people; and these beneficent virtues with them, like
the mental operations of faith, hope, and charity of the
Christians, mark the perfect man.</p>

<p>They regard the white people, as very deficient in one
of these cardinal virtues. They have been told by Indians,
who have visited our settlements, that on entering
the lodge of a white man, they will be informed that he
has eaten his dinner, he will not, at least, set any food
before them, and if they remain in the house, nothing is
offered them until night, and even then, probably, but a
stinted portion. The meanness of such demeanour they
despise.</p>

<p>If a white man, or any stranger, enters the habitation
of an Indian, he is not asked if he has dined, or if he is
hungry, but independently of the time of the day or night,
the pot is put upon the fire, and if there is but a single
pound of meat in the possession of the family, that pound
is cooked and set before him, and even if he has but just
arisen from a feast, he must taste of the food, or offence is
given. History has recorded, with high commendation,
the name of a dethroned Christian monarch, who shared
his last loaf of bread with a suppliant stranger; and surely
a similar act in the Indian, although it be influenced by
education and custom, is entitled to respect and applause.</p>

<p>They look upon the traffic in the necessaries of life,
such as meat and maize, amongst the individuals of a
nation, as contemptible. Such commerce they consider
as a very unfavourable trait in the character of the white
man; they, however, avail themselves of it in their dealings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
with him, provided he wants a considerable supply of those
necessaries.</p>

<p>{44} The food which is set before a guest, is, in every respect,
considered as exclusively his own; he may give it
to whom he may think proper, either within or without
the lodge; he may even take it with him to his own
lodgings, but the including vessel, must, in either case,
be returned.</p>

<p>Much more food is usually served up to a guest than
he can possibly eat, and when he has satisfied his hunger,
if he return the remainder to the host, the latter thanks him
for it, as if he had received a favour.</p>

<p>So exemplary is their hospitality, that every stranger,
even an enemy, is protected in the habitation of an Omawhaw,
as far as the power and influence of the owner extends;
he is immediately invited to sit down, and no
questions are put to him. The master of the house is
evidently ill at ease, until the food is prepared for eating,
he will request his squaws to expedite it, and will even stir
the fire himself. When the guest has finished his meal,
the pipe is handed to him to smoke, after which the conversation
begins either vocally or by signs. As soon as it
is known that a stranger is in the village, he is invited to
various feasts, at each of which he must reciprocate the
politeness of the host, by partaking of his fare; the stranger
is not unfrequently followed from lodge to lodge by several
persons, who wish to secure him as a guest in their turn.</p>

<p>In the kindest spirit of hospitality, they are always careful
to treat their guests in the manner which they suppose
will be most agreeable to them. A trader was invited to
a feast, and the food being prepared, a squaw who was
about to serve it up, in order to clean a bowl to contain it,
began to scoop it with her curved finger. Her husband
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
observing this usual mode of depuration, reprimanded her,
saying, "I have told you that the white people do not like
to see bowls cleaned in that manner, give me the vessel,
and I will show you how they clean {45} them." He then
drew out one corner of his breech-clout, and substituted
it for a towel, wiped the bowl thoroughly, and returned it
to the squaw. The trader, as in duty bound, tasted of the
contents, but he would have preferred the agency of the
finger of the squaw, to that of the old breech-clout of the
husband.</p>

<p>An unknown stranger is led to the lodge of the principal
chief, where the inhabitants collect to see him, and do not
hesitate to gratify their curiosity, by looking steadfastly
in his face. The stranger, if an Indian, appears perfectly
at his ease, not seeming to notice the crowd that surrounds
him, in order that he may not encounter their eyes. After
he has eaten and smoked, he delivers his message, states
his business, or tells the news. If he is seated in a small
skin lodge, which contains but few persons, one of these
will repeat his words aloud, that the crowd without may
hear.</p>

<p>They are pleased with the society of the Canadian
French, but they do not appear to respect them highly,
because they permit too much familiarity, and are not
forward in revenging an insult. The Spaniards, probably
from the representations of the Pawnees, who war against
them, are held in but little esteem. But it is readily perceivable,
as well from their own deportment as from the
representations of the French, that they respect the character
of the Americans (citizens of the United States)
above that of any other nation, because, they are pleased to
say, we are the bravest of the white people. Previously
to the late war between the United States and Great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
Britain, the British are said to have been deemed most
valorous. But, say they, the Ioways have informed us,
that, at the commencement of the war, the British promised
to give the Indians who took part with them in the
contest, all the territory that lies westward of a great river,
(the Ohio,) over which they declared they would drive {46}
the Americans. Their subsequent inability to comply
with this promise, together with an indistinct idea of some
of the conflicts, both by land and water, on our Canadian
frontier, lead them to suppose that the Americans conquered
in that war, and that they are now the most powerful
of the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>Like the ancients the Indians have no rhymes in their
poetry. They imitate the sounds of the voice of various
animals, and of some, with so much success, as to deceive
even such persons as are familiar with the animals thus
imitated. This mimicry extends to the voices of the bear,
bison, deer, wolves, prairie dog, turkey, owl, &amp;c. together
with those of some smaller birds, the notes of which are
simple. But in these imitations we knew of no individual,
whose art enabled him to execute so great a variety of notes,
and with so much melody, as we have heard from civilized
performers, who have publicly exhibited their talents in
this way, in our cities.</p>

<p>An Indian at his temporary night encampment, hearing
the unexpected cry of an owl, wolf, &amp;c., is generally suspicious
of its proceeding from a human enemy, who is thus
endeavouring to lull him into fancied security; such sounds
being often made by war parties, on their nocturnal approach
to their victims, to induce a belief that the animals
around them are undisturbed.</p>

<p>They also imitate the motions of different animals, playfully,
sometimes grotesquely, in their dances.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V_III">{47} CHAPTER V {III}</h2>

<p class="hang">Tribes and Bands—Fabulous Legends—Wit—Ninnegahe,
or Mixed Tobacco—Dances—Otoes—Migrations—Language.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Omawhaw nation is divided into two principal
sections or tribes, which are distinguished by the names
Honga-sha-no and Ish-ta-sun-da; the latter means Grey
Eyes.</p>

<p>The first-mentioned tribe is subdivided into eight
bands, viz.</p>

<p>1. <i>Wase-ish-ta.</i>—This band is interdicted from eating
the flesh of male deer or male elk, in consequence of
having their great medicine, which is a large shell, enveloped
in the prepared skin of those animals. The
chief of this band is the Big Elk, Ongpatungah; and it
is more powerful and numerous in individuals than
either of the others.</p>

<p>The shell, which is regarded as an object of great
sanctity and superstitious reverence, by the whole nation,
has been transmitted from the ancestry of this band, and
its origin is unknown. A skin lodge or temple is appropriated
for its preservation, in which a person constantly
resides, charged with the care of it, and appointed its
guard. It is placed upon a stand, and is never suffered
to touch the earth. It is concealed from the sight by
several envelops, which are composed of strands of the
proper skins, plaited and joined together in the form of a
mat. The whole constitutes a parcel of considerable
size, from which various articles are suspended, such as
tobacco and roots of certain plants.</p>

<p>No person dares to open all the coverings of this sacred
deposit, in order to expose the shell to view. {48} Tradition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
informs them, that curiosity induced three different
persons to examine the mysterious shell, who were immediately
punished for their profanation, by instant and
total loss of sight. The last of these offenders, whose
name is Ish-ka-tappe, is still living. It was ten years
since that he attempted to unveil the sacred shell, but,
like his predecessors, he was visited by blindness, which
still continues, and is attributed by the Indians, as well as
by himself, to his committing of the forbidden act.</p>

<p>This shell is taken with the band to all the national
hunts, and is transported by means of a hoppas on the
back of a man.</p>

<p>Previously to undertaking a national expedition against
an enemy, the sacred shell is consulted as an oracle. For
this purpose, the magi of the band seat themselves around
the great medicine lodge, the lower part of which is then
thrown up like curtains, and the exterior envelop is carefully
removed from the mysterious parcel, that the shell
may receive air. A portion of the tobacco, consecrated
by being long suspended to the skin mats, or coverings of
the shell, is now taken and distributed to the magi, who
fill their pipes with it, to smoke to the great medicine.
During this ceremony, an individual occasionally inclines
his head forward, and listens attentively to catch some
sound which he expects to issue from the shell. At length
some one imagines that he hears a sound like that of a
forced expiration of air from the lungs, or like the noise
made by the report of a gun at a great distance. This is
considered as a favourable omen, and the nation prepare
for the projected expedition with a confidence of success.
But, on the contrary, should no sound be perceived, the
issue of the expedition would be considered doubtful.</p>

<p>2. <i>Enk-ka-sa-ba.</i>—This band will not eat red maize.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
They ascribe to their family the greatest antiquity, and
declare that their first man emerged {49} from the water,
with an ear of red maize in his hand. The principal chief
is Ishkatappe.</p>

<p>3. <i>Wa-sa-ba-eta-je</i>; or, those who do not touch bears.—This
band refrains from eating the flesh of bears.</p>

<p>4. <i>Ka-e-ta-je</i>, or those who do not touch turtles or
tortoises.</p>

<p>5. <i>Wa-jinga-e-ta-je</i>, or those who do not touch any
kind of bird, excepting the war-eagle.</p>

<p>6. <i>Hun-guh.</i>—This band does not eat white cranes,
as the down of that bird is their medicine.</p>

<p>7. <i>Kon-za.</i>—This band must not touch the green clay,
or even verdigrise, both of which are used as pigments
by the other bands, for ornamenting their persons.</p>

<p>8. <i>Ta-pa-taj-je.</i>—This band must not touch deers'
heads, neither must they wear deer-skin mockasins.
Many of the individuals of this band are partially gray
haired. This change of the hair, which they consider as
a deformity, is attributed to a violation of the abovementioned
laws prescribed by their medicine.</p>

<p>The second division, or tribe <i>Ishtasunda</i>, is subdivided
into five bands.</p>

<p>1. <i>Ta-pa-eta-je.</i>—This band does not touch bison
heads.</p>

<p>2. <i>Mon-eka-goh-ha</i>, or the earth-makers.—Of this
band was the celebrated Black Bird. They are not
forbidden the use of any aliment; and are said to have
originated the present mode of mourning, by rubbing
the body with whitish clay.</p>

<p>3. <i>Ta-sin-da</i>, or the bison tail.—This band does not
eat bison calves, in the first year of the age of that animal.</p>

<p>4. <i>Ing-gera-je-da</i>, or the red dung.—This name is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
said to have originated from the circumstance of this
band having formerly quarrelled, and separated themselves
from the nation, until, being nearly {50} starved,
they were compelled to eat the fruit of the wild cherry-tree,
until their excrement became red.</p>

<p>5. <i>Wash-a-tung.</i>—This band must not touch any
of the reptilia class of animals.</p>

<p>Each of these animals, or parts of animals, which the
bands respectively are forbidden to touch or eat, is regarded
as the particular mysterious medicine of the band
collectively, to which it relates.</p>

<p>This singular, and, to us, absurd law, of interdiction,
is generally rigidly observed; and a violation of it, they
firmly believe, will be followed by some signal judgment,
such as blindness, gray hairs, or general misfortune.
Even should the forbidden food be eaten inadvertently,
or but tasted through ignorance, sickness they believe
would be the inevitable consequence, not only to the
unfortunate individual himself, but involving his wife
and children also.</p>

<p>The name of one of the bands of the Puncaw nation is
<i>Wa-jaja</i>, corresponding to the name which the Osages
acknowledge, which is <i>Waw-sash-e</i>.</p>

<p>We have before observed, that they take great pleasure
in relating and hearing the narration of fabulous legends.
The following specimen will serve to exemplify their
taste in this way.</p>

<p>A bison bull, an ant, and a tortoise, agreed to undertake
a joint war excursion, against the village of a neighbouring
nation. As the latter associate was a slow
walker, it was mutually decided in council, that he should
set out on the journey immediately, to be followed in a
short time by his more active companions. The tortoise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
accordingly departed alone, making his way through the
grass, with as much rapidity as possible. After a proper
interval had elapsed, the bull also set out; and lest he
should lose his fellow traveller, he consented to take him
on his back. On their way the two champions were
obliged to cross a miry place, in the midst of which they
overtook the tortoise, struggling onward with {51} the
utmost labour, and apparently almost exhausted. They
did not fail, as they passed gaily by the sluggish reptile,
to express their surprise at his unusually tardy movements,
and at the circumstance of his being apparently almost
subdued by the first obstacle that presented itself. The
tortoise, however, not at all discouraged, requested them
to continue their journey, and expressed his confident
expectation of being able to extricate himself from the
mire, without the aid which they did not seem forward in
offering to him. The two companions arrived at the
village of the enemy, and were so incautious in their
approaches to it, as to be discovered by the inhabitants,
who sallied out upon them, and succeeded in wounding
them both. The tortoise at length reached the village,
and was also discovered, but had the additional misfortune
of being taken prisoner.</p>

<p>To punish him for his presumption, the enemy resolved
to put him to death in such a manner as would be most
painful to him. They accordingly threatened him successively
with a number of different forms of torture, such as
baking in hot embers, boiling, &amp;c., with each of which
the captive artfully expressed his entire satisfaction.
They finally proposed to drown him; and this mode of
punishment being so earnestly protested against by the
tortoise, they determined to carry it into immediate
execution.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

<p>With this view, several of the enemy carried him out
into a deep part of the river, and threw him in.</p>

<p>The tortoise, thus released, and, through the ignorance
of the captors in the art of torturing, abandoned to an
element in which he could act freely and with much
power, dived down from their view, and rising again,
dragged two or three of them under water successively,
and scalped them. Then rising above the surface of the
water, he exhibited the scalps triumphantly to the enemy,
who stood in {52} crowds upon the bank of the river,
unable to injure him. Content with his fortunate achievement,
the tortoise now journeyed homeward; and on
arriving at his lodge, he found there the bull and ant,
both in bed, groaning piteously with their wounds.</p>

<p>Upon the reality of such stories, many of the auditors
seem to rely with implicit faith, particularly as their
occurrence is referred to the chronology of former times,
by such a prefatory notice as "once upon a time."
The narrator proceeds with a degree of gravity of feature
suitable to the nature of the events of his story; and notes
a variety of little circumstances in detail, which contribute
much to give the whole an air of truth to
his auditors, who listen with an undivided attention,
uttering occasionally an interjection, as their feelings are
excited.</p>

<p>That the inferior animals did, in ancient times, march
to battle with simultaneous regularity, that they conversed
intelligibly, and performed all the different actions of
men, many of them appear to admit, with as much faith
as many equally absurd doctrines are believed in Christendom.
But these qualities are supposed to be no longer
inherent; and if an animal should now speak with the
voice of man, it is either the effect of the immediate inspiration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
of the Wahconda, or the apparent animal is no other
than the Wahconda himself incarnate.</p>

<p>The Indians sometimes indulge in pleasantry in their
conversation; and Shaumonekusse seemed to be eminently
witty—a quality strongly indicated by his well-marked
features of countenance. Their wit, however, is generally
obscene, particularly when in conversation with the squaws.</p>

<p>Washingguhsahba, conversing familiarly with a Frenchman,
who had long resided in the Omawhaw village,
observed that the white people, being in the habit of
reading books with the desire of acquiring knowledge,
probably knew the cause of the difference of colour which
exists between themselves and {53} the Indian; he therefore
requested information from the Frenchman on this
subject. The latter, assuming an air of great gravity,
assured him that the cause was very well known, and was
no other than that the Indian was formed of red horse-dung.
The chief, with every appearance of candour,
which, however, he did not feel, instantly placed his hand
on the arm of his companion, and replied that this observation
was a convincing proof of the great knowledge of
the white people, and that they were perfectly familiar
with the early operations of the Master of Life. He had
no doubt, he said, that they were equally well informed
as to the matter out of which they were themselves formed;
but if he, a poor ignorant Indian, with no knowledge but
his own, might venture to give his opinion, he would say,
that they were formed of the excrement of the dog, baked
white in the prairie.</p>

<p>They sometimes employ an indirect method of communicating
information, and of explaining some particular
acts of their own, which may have been erroneously
construed by others.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>Several Omawhaws, accompanied by a Frenchman,
one day passed our cantonment, on their way to the
trading house, with a considerable quantity of jerked
meat. On their return they visited us; when one of
them, who amused himself by turning over the leaves of
a book in search of pictures, being asked by a squaw, in
a jocular manner, what the book said, replied, "It tells
me, that when we were taking our meat to the trading
house, we wished to present some of it to white people
on the way, but that the Frenchman would not permit
us to do so." This remark explained the reason of their
having offered us no meat.</p>

<p>An Indian, observing that one of our men, when
cutting wood, uttered the interjection <i>hah!</i> at each blow
with the axe, smiled; and asked if it assisted him, or
added force to the blow.</p>

<p>{54} The Kinnecanick, or, as the Omawhaws call it,
<i>Ninnegahe</i>, mixed or made tobacco, which they use for
smoking in their pipes, is composed partly of tobacco, and
partly of the leaves of the sumack (rhus glabrum); but
many prefer to the latter ingredient, the inner bark of the
red willow (cornus sericea); and when neither of the
two latter can be obtained, the inner bark of the arrow
wood (viburnum) is substituted for them. These two
ingredients are well dried over the fire, and comminuted
together by friction between the hands.</p>

<p>Their pipes are neatly made of the red indurated clay,
which they procure from the red pipestone branch of
the Sioux river.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> The mass is readily cut with a common
knife.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>They frequently eject the smoke through the nostrils,
and often inhale it into the lungs, from which it is gradually
ejected again as they converse, or in expiration.</p>

<p>An Omawhaw, after an eructation of wind from the
stomach, is often heard to say, "<i>How-wa-ne-ta</i>," thank
you, animal; which they explain by saying, that some
animal has presented itself to the hunter. The exclamation,
however, has but an obscure meaning, and may be
compared as somewhat similar to the "God bless you"
of the French, after the convulsion of sneezing.</p>

<p>They indulge much in the pleasures of dancing, and
their dances are of various denominations; of which the
following may be particularized.</p>

<p>The calumet dance, <i>nin-ne-ba-wa-wong</i>, is a very favourite
dance. It is usually performed by two individuals,
in honour, and in the presence, of some one of their
own or of a neighbouring nation, with the expectation of
receiving presents in return. A person who intends to perform
this dance sends a messenger, bearing a small skin
containing tobacco to fill a pipe, to the individual whom
he intends to honour. If the proposed compliment should
not be {55} acceptable, it is refused in the most courteous
manner, with excuses based upon poverty, and with
many thanks for the honour intended. If, on the contrary,
the tobacco should be accepted and smoked, the
act shows that the visit also will be acceptable; and a
time is fixed for the performance of the ceremony. At the
appointed time, the dancers, with two selected companions,
repair to the place of their destination, and are invited
into the lodge of the person whom they addressed. After
a short time, the calumet is placed upon a forked support,
which is driven into the soil in the back part of the lodge.
Notice is then given to the bearer of the calumet respecting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
the time when it will be convenient for the dance to take
place. The bearer of the calumet is now considered as
the <i>father</i>, and addresses the individual whom he is about
to honour by the title of <i>son</i>, presenting him with some
valuable articles; such as a gun, kettle, blankets, and
clothing and ornaments for his youngest child, who is
destined to represent the father, or the adopted son, at
the ensuing ceremony.</p>

<p>At sunset the calumet is taken from the forked stick,
or support, enveloped like an infant in swaddling clothes,
and placed carefully in a bed, prepared for its reception;
a lullaby is then sung, accompanied by the music of the
rattle, for its quiet repose. On the following morning it
is <i>awakened</i> by a song, with the same music, and again
consigned to its forked support. The appointed day
having arrived, a space of sufficient diameter, is enclosed
by a skreen of skins for the dance, and a post is fixed in
the earth, near the entrance to the area. Around this
area the principal men of the nation seat themselves; the
adopted son leads in his youthful representative; and
the two dancers, decorated with paint, and entirely
destitute of clothing, with the exception of the breech-cloth,
commence the dance. They are each provided
with a decorated calumet stem, and a rattle {56} of dried
skin, or a gourd, containing pebbles, with which to keep
time to the music of the gong, and to the vocal chanting
of the musicians of the village. They dance in the
ordinary manner of the Indians, and pass backwards and
forwards between the entrance and back part of the area,
endeavouring to exhibit as much agility as possible in their
movements, throwing themselves into a great variety of
attitudes imitative of the actions of the war eagle, preserving
at the same time a constant waving motion with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
the calumet in the left hand, and agitating the gourd in
the right, more or less vehemently, agreeably to the music.</p>

<p>Warriors and braves will now bring forward presents
of horses, guns, &amp;c. The bridle of the horse is attached
to the post, by the donor, who receives the thanks of an
old crier, stationed there to perform that duty. The
music now ceases, whilst the donor <i>strikes the post</i>, and
recounts his martial deeds, and boasts of the presents
which he has made at different times on similar occasions.
Sometimes during the ceremony, a warrior will take the
gong from the performer, and strike upon it as many
times as he has achieved brave and generous actions; he
then sets it down, and no one must dare to touch it, but
such as can strike upon it more frequently than the first;
if this is done, the gong is returned to the performer.</p>

<p>The calumet dance sometimes continues two or three
days; but each night the calumet is consigned to its
repose in the bed, with the same ceremonies as those of
the first night.</p>

<p>When all the presents have been made which the dancers
have reason to expect, they depart immediately with them
to their own nation or lodge.</p>

<p>Instead of striking the post, the donors sometimes
strike lightly upon the persons of the dancers themselves.</p>

<p>The presents sometimes made at these dances are
very considerable. Ongpatunga once danced the {57}
calumet to Tarrarecawaho, the grand Pawnee chief, and
received from him between eighty and ninety horses.
The Pawnees are indeed distinguished both for their
liberality and dexterity at this ceremony. They gave
one hundred and forty horses last autumn to the Otoes,
who performed this dance at their village. A party of
Pawnees once danced at the Omawhaw village, and gave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
so much satisfaction to many individuals of this nation,
as to receive extraordinary presents from them. On
this occasion, one person, in the warmth of his feelings,
brought forth his child, and presented it to them, as the
most precious gift in his power to bestow. The Pawnees
accepted this gift; but on their departure, they returned
the child to its parent, accompanied by the present of a
fine horse, upon which it was mounted.</p>

<p>The dance of discovering the enemy.—This dance is
sometimes performed in honour of strangers; at other
times, chiefs are invited by the warriors, who wish to
exhibit their generosity in presenting them with horses,
and to detail their own warlike feats in the ceremony of
striking the post. The chiefs, on this occasion, seat
themselves in a circle, on the outside of which the warriors
are also seated in a ring or circle, concentric with that of
the chiefs.</p>

<p>These arrangements being completed, the music strikes
up, and a warrior advances, who takes a war-club and
<i>crow</i>, provided for the purpose; the latter of which he
belts around his waist. He then dances with a slow,
shuffling motion, around the exterior circle, exhibiting at
the same time a pantomimic representation of his combats
with the enemy.</p>

<p>By and by the music beats a quicker time, and calls
for corresponding movements on the part of the dancer,
until at length both cease simultaneously. The warrior
then advances to the post, which he strikes with his club,
and proceeds to detail one of his deeds of war. This done,
the music recalls him {58} to the dance, and after a short
time again ceases, that he may continue his chivalric
history.</p>

<p>This alternate dance and recitation continues until the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
tale of the warrior is told; when he resigns his crow and
war-club to another, who continues the amusement in
like manner. Most of the dancers present horses to the
chiefs, after the performing of their respective parts; and
it is generally the case, that each chief invited is rewarded
with one of those animals in return for the honour of his
attendance.</p>

<p>The bear dance, <i>Mot-chu-wat-che</i>.—This is a <i>medicine</i>
dance, not distinguished by any very remarkable traits.
The dancers, however, imitate the motions of the bear;
and songs, in which there are many words, are sung.</p>

<p>The beggar dance.—This has been already described
in our account of the visit of the Otoes, at our cantonment
last autumn. This is probably the dance mentioned by
Carver, in page 158. of his work; the performance of
which, on his landing near Lake Pepin, by a party of
Chippeways, was the cause of much alarm to his party.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>The bison dance, <i>Ta-nuguh-wat-che</i>.—The performers
in this dance are painted black, and are naked from
the waist upward, with the exception of the head dress,
which is composed of the skin of the head of a bison, the
face of which is cut off and rejected; so adapted to the
top of their head as to resemble a cap, the horns projecting
forward in such a manner as to correspond with their
appearance when on the head of the bison. Attached
to this head dress, is a strip of the skin from the back of
the bison, which hangs down behind to the buttocks, like
a tail. In the evolutions of the dance, they imitate the
actions of the bison.</p>

<p>Amongst the Minnetarees, is a ceremony called the
corn dance; which, however, has but little claim to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
title of a dance. Notice being given of this ceremony,
by the village criers, the squaws repair to {59} the medicine
lodge, in which the magi are seated, performing their
incantations, carrying with them a portion of each kind
of seed which they respectively intend to plant the ensuing
season; as an ear of maize, some pumpkin, water-melon,
or tobacco-seed. These are attached to the end of small
sticks, which are stuck in the ground, so as to form a right
line in front of the magi. The squaws then strip themselves
entirely of their garments, and take their seats before
the spectators. The magi then throw themselves into a
violent agitation, singing, leaping about, pointing to the
sky, the earth, the sun, and the north star, successively.
After these paroxysms have subsided, the squaws arise;
and each one taking her respective sticks, holds them up
with extended arms.</p>

<p>One of the magi being provided with a large bunch
of a species of bitter herb, dips it in a vessel of water,
and sprinkles copiously the seeds and persons of the
squaws, with much grotesque gesticulation. This concludes
the ceremony; when the seeds are supposed to be
fertilized, and to be capable of communicating their fertility
to any quantity of their kind.</p>

<p>The women then assume their clothing, and return
home, being careful to deposit the fertilized seed with
their stock; after which they may proceed to planting
as soon as they please.</p>

<p>We were informed that on some particular occasion,
a large enclosure was constructed in the village of the
Minnetarees, which was covered with jerked meat,
instead of skins. The distinguished warriors who were
concerned in the ceremony about to take place, deputed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
some of their party to summon a certain number of the
handsomest young married squaws of the village, who
immediately repaired to {60} the meat-covered lodge,
with the consent of their husbands. The squaws were
then disrobed in the midst of a considerable number of
the bravest of the Minnetaree warriors; and after the
conclusion of some ceremonies a <i>brave</i> entered, leading
by the halter a very fine horse. He selected a squaw,
whose beauty struck his fancy; and advancing to her,
he laid the cord of the halter in her hand. She accepted
the present, and immediately admitted him to her favour.
Other warriors appeared in succession, leading horses, all
of which were very readily disposed of in the same manner.
This ceremony occurred during the day, and in the
presence of the whole assembly.</p>

<p>In the same nation a singular night dance is, it is said,
sometimes held. During this amusement an opportunity
is given to the squaws to select their favourites. A squaw,
as she dances, will advance to a person with whom she
is captivated, either for his personal attractions, or for
his renown in arms, she taps him on the shoulder, and
immediately runs out of the lodge, and betakes herself
to the bushes, followed by the favourite. But if it should
happen, that he has a particular preference for another,
from whom he expects the same favour, or if he is restrained
by a vow, or is already satiated with indulgence, he
politely declines her offer, by placing his hand in her
bosom. On which they return to the assembly and
rejoin the dance. It is worthy of remark that in the
language of the Omawhaws the word <i>watche</i> applies
equally to the amusement of dancing, and to sexual
intercourse; but to avoid being misunderstood in speaking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
of the former they sometimes add the word gaha, <i>to
make</i>.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>What length of time the Omawhaws have resided on
the Missouri is unknown; but it seems highly probable
that they were not there when Mr. Bourgmont<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> performed
his journey to the Padoucas, in the year 1724, as he
makes no mention whatever of them. It would seem,
indeed, that they had separated from the great migrating
nation, that we shall further notice below, on or near the
Mississippi, and that they had since passed slowly across
the country, or perhaps up the St. Peter's,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> until they
finally struck {61} the Missouri at the mouth of the Sioux
river. This is rendered highly probable by the circumstance
of Carver having met with them on the St. Peter's
in the year 1766, associated with the Shienne and others,
all of whom he represents as bands of the Naudowessie
nation.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>The Oto nation of Indians is distinguished by the name
of <i>Wah-toh-ta-na</i>. The permanent village of this nation
is composed of large dirt lodges, similar to those of the
Konzas and Omawhaws, and is situate on the left bank
of the river Platte, or Nebraska, about forty miles above its
confluence with the Missouri. Although this nation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
distinguish themselves by the name of Wahtohtata, yet
when questioned respecting the signification of the word,
they say it ought to be pronounced Wah-toh-ta-na, or
Wa-do-tan, which means those who will copulate. This
singular designation which they have adopted, was
applied to the nation in consequence of their chief, at the
period of their separation from the Missouries on the
Mississippi, having carried off a squaw from that nation.
The nation is, however, only known to the white people
by the name of Oto, Otto, or Othouez.</p>

<p>It thus appears, that their name has been adopted
subsequently to the migration and partition of the great
nation of which they were formerly but a band. This
great nation, they say, originally resided somewhere to
the northward of the great lakes; and on their emigration
southwardly, after performing a considerable journey,
a large band of them, called Ho-ro-ge, or Fish Eaters,
from their fondness of fish, separated from the main
body, and established their residence on the margin of a
lake. This band is now known by the name of Winnebagoe.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>During the journey of the great nation, another band
separated from them on the Mississippi, and received
the name of <i>Pa-ho-ja</i>, or Gray Snow, which they still
retain; but are known to the white people by the name
of Ioways, or Aiaouez. They have, {62} however, been
distinguished by the name of <i>Pierced-noses</i>, as this was
erroneously believed to be the meaning of the word
Pahoja; and it will be confessed that the distinction is
somewhat nice, when we learn that the true word for
pierced nose is <i>pa-o-ja</i>.</p>

<p>Another band seceded from the migrating nation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
and established a village at the mouth of the Missouri
river; from which circumstance they received the name
of <i>Ne-o-ta-cha</i> or <i>Ne-o-ge-he</i>, signifying <i>those who build
a town at the entrance of a river</i>; they have been known
to us only by the name of Missouries.</p>

<p>The Otoes also separated from the nation on the
Mississippi; and pursuing their journey across the
country from that river, struck the Missouri near the
confluence of the Great Nemawhaw. Here the Otoes
remained a considerable time for the purpose of hunting;
and it seems probable, from the name of the creek, that
they also reared maize, and cultivated the soil after their
rude manner, as the word Nemawhaw, in their language,
signifies <i>water of cultivation</i>; <i>ne</i>, water, and <i>maha</i>, planting
or cultivating. From this locality the Otoes proceeded
up the river to the Platte; and after hunting for
some time near its confluence, they moved still further
up the Missouri, and established a village on its bank,
about fourteen miles below Council Bluff. In this
position they remained several years, during which time
a band of the Ioways took up their residence about one
year, on the bank of the river nearly opposite to them,
and within about thirty miles of the present site of the
Omawhaw village. The Otoes subsequently removed
to the river Platte, about twenty miles above their present
village; but finding the latter situation to be a more
eligible one, they permanently established themselves
there, and have already occupied it nearly half a century.</p>

<p>The Ioways, after having resided in a village on {63}
the lower part of the Missouri a considerable space of
time, were rejoined by the band above mentioned; when
they abandoned their position, and returned to the waters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
of the Mississippi and erected a village on the <i>Moyene</i>,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>
where it still remains.</p>

<p>The Missouries in process of time abandoned their
village near the mouth of the river Missouri, and gradually
moving up the river, at length constructed a town on the
left bank, near the entrance of Grand river. In this
position they were found by the French, who built a fort
on an island of the Missouri, in their immediate vicinity,
about the beginning of the last century. The garrison of
this fort was entirely destroyed, according to Du Pratz,
soon after its commander, the enterprizing Bourgmont,
left it.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>The author whom we have just mentioned further
informs us respecting this nation, that "the Spaniards,
as well as our other neighbours, being continually jealous
of our superiority over them, formed a design of establishing
themselves among the Missouries, about forty
leagues from the Illinois, in order to limit our boundaries
westward. They judged it necessary for the security of
their colony, entirely to cut off the Missouries; and for
that purpose they courted the friendship of the Osages,
whose assistance they thought would be of service to
them in the enterprise, and who were generally at enmity
with the Missouries. A company of Spaniards, men,
women, and soldiers, accordingly set out from Santa Fe,
having a Dominican for their chaplain, and an engineer
for their guide and commander. The caravan was furnished
with horses, and all other kinds of beasts necessary;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
for it is one of their prudent maxims, to send off all those
things together. By a fatal mistake the Spaniards
arrived first amongst the Missouries, whom they mistook
for the Osages; and imprudently discovering their hostile
intentions, they were themselves surprised and cut off
by those whom they intended for destruction. {64} The
Missouries some time afterwards dressed themselves
with the ornaments of the chapel; and carried them in
a kind of triumphant procession to the French commandant
among the Illinois."<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> A terrible but just revenge!
The Missouries continued to dwell in the same locality,
until, about twenty years since, they were conquered and
dispersed, by a combination of the Sauks, Foxes, and
some other Indians; when they united their destiny with
other friendly nations. Five or six lodges joined the
Osages; two or three took refuge with the Konzas; and
the chief part of the remainder amalgamated with the
Oto nation, with whom they still reside. Thus connected,
their manners, habits, and language being very closely
allied, the Otoes and Missouries may be considered as one
nation. They are probably the bravest of the native
inhabitants of the Missouri; and there are but few males
who have arrived at the age of maturity, that have not
fleshed their arms in battle. Indeed, many of them can
<i>strike</i> upon individuals of almost all the neighbouring
nations, not excepting the distant Indians of Mexico, and
the Spaniards themselves.</p>

<p>In vain should we seek among the nations of the
Missouri for an individual whose daring deeds have been
more numerous than those of the Little Soldier, or for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
more brave and generous combatants than Shaumonekusse,
Hashea, Nahojeningya, and Wasacaruja. It is
not fear, but probably a generous forbearance, that has
restrained them from killing more than two white men
within the memory of the present generation. Of these,
one, a Frenchman, was killed by A-kira-ba during the
Spanish government; and the other, a Spaniard, by
Shaumonekusse, more recently, at the sources of the
Arkansa; an act, which, although attended by an extraordinary
display of bravery, was declared by this young
warrior to be the only martial act of his life that he was
ashamed of.</p>

<p>{65} The hunting grounds of the Oto nation extend
from the Little Platte up to the Boyer creek, on the north
side of the Missouri, and from Independence creek to
about forty miles above the Platte, on the south side of
that river. They hunt the bison between the Platte and
the sources of the Konza rivers.</p>

<p>A few years since, their numbers were very much
diminished by the small-pox.</p>

<p>The language of the Otoes, Missouries, and Ioways,
although the same, is somewhat differently pronounced
by these respective nations or tribes. The dialect of
the Ioways is more closely allied to that of the Oto than
to the Missouri dialect; the former differs chiefly in
being pronounced more sharply, as in the word In-ta-ra,
<i>friend</i>, which in the Oto is In-ta-ro. The Missouri
dialect differs in being more nasal; the children, however,
of this nation being, from their residence among the
Otoes, in constant habits of association with the Oto
children, are gradually assuming the pronunciation of
that nation.</p>

<p>Originally the same, and still very similar to the above
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
dialects, are those of the Osages, Konzas, Omawhaws,
and Puncaws, the individuals of each of which nations
can make themselves reciprocally understood, after a
very little practice. The two latter dialects are so very
closely allied, as not to be distinguishable from each
other, by persons who are not very critically acquainted
with the language. The Omawhaw and Puncaw pronunciation
is more guttural than that of the two former,
of which, particularly the Osage, the pronunciation is
more brief and vivid.</p>

<p>The free and independent spirit of the Indian is
carried even into their language, and may be recognised
there by its absolute destitution of a single word drawn
from the language of a civilised people. Thus, notwithstanding
their constant familiarity with {66} certain
traders, and with various articles of the manufacture of
the white people, they universally, and in every instance,
reject the names which they originally hear for such
men and things, and apply others, which they readily
invent.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI_IV">{67} CHAPTER VI {IV}</h2>

<p class="hang">Boyer's Creek—Visit to the Pawnees—Human Sacrifices—Anecdote
of Petalesharoo—Appendix.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 12th, Lieutenant Graham, Lieutenant Talcott
of Camp Missouri, Mr. Seymour, and I, accompanied
by a soldier, departed in our small row-boat, for the purpose
of ascending Boyer creek,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> and ascertaining the
point at which that stream discharges from the bluffs.
The rapidity of the Missouri current soon transported
us to the mouth of the creek, and we encamped, after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
ascending it the distance of a few miles. From this point
Messrs. Graham and Talcott crossed the bottom lands,
to the base of the bluffs, and by trigonometrical observation,
ascertained the altitude of the highest point to
be three hundred and fifty feet above low water mark of
the Missouri. The next day we continued our voyage,
but about noon, perceiving that some necessaries had
inadvertently been omitted in our loading, we despatched
the soldier to the cantonment to procure them.</p>

<p>The following morning we were awakened by the
loud cries of the sandhill crane, performing evolutions
in the air, high over their feeding grounds. This stately
bird is known to authors by the name of grus canadensis.
It is mentioned by the enterprizing and excellent traveller,
Bartram,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> in his work, and is very distinct from the grus
Americanus of authors, or hooping crane, although many
persons have supposed it to be no other than the young
of that gigantic species. The sandhill crane, in the spring
of the year, removes the surface of the soil by {68} scratching
with its feet, in search of the radical tubers of the pea
vine, which seem to afford them a very palatable food.
Near our present encampment, and in many other situations
bordering on streams of water, where this plant
vegetates in the greatest profusion, we have frequently
had occasion to observe that the surface of the soil was
removed in small and irregular patches, by the industry
of this bird in seeking for its favourite food.</p>

<p>This crane is a social bird, sometimes assembling
together in considerable flocks. They were now in great
numbers, soaring aloft in the air, flying with an irregular
kind of gyratory motion, each individual describing a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
large circle in the air independently of his associates,
and uttering loud, dissonant, and repeated cries. They
sometimes continue thus to wing their flight upwards,
gradually receding from the earth, until they become
mere specks upon the sight, and finally altogether disappear,
leaving only the discordant music of their concert
to fall faintly upon the ear.</p>

<p>Mosquitoes have already made their appearance in
small numbers.</p>

<p>April 14th. The messenger returned and the voyage
was continued. The creek was found to be very tortuous,
and the navigation much impeded by fallen trees, extending
in various directions across the stream, obliging us
to resort to the use of the axe in many places, to obtain a
passage for our boat. In the evening we arrived at the
bluffs. The water had now become so shallow as not
to admit of our further passage with the boat, which was
left under the care of our man, and having made the
necessary observations for ascertaining the latitude, on
the following day we took our blankets on our backs, and
proceeded on foot, intending to travel one day's journey
further along the stream. At the distance of about five
miles, the high grounds closely bounded the creek, and
the valley, which below is extensive {69} and fertile, disappears.
We saw numbers of the smaller species of
rattle-snake, which had, no doubt, but lately left their
winter dwelling. The creek, as observed this afternoon,
although still about thirty feet wide, is, in some places,
not more than six inches deep, whilst in other parts it is
two or three feet. As we went forward, the timber
gradually decreased in quantity, until finally it was
interrupted into remote small assemblages of trees, under
one of which we spread our blankets, after a sultry day's
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
march over a tolerably fertile country. Numbers of ant
hills are dispersed over the soil, and in many places are
abundant; we could not choose but admire the assiduous
industry of the little inhabitants, who were now engaged
in repairing the structures for the approaching season of
activity. The autumnal conflagration, which had comprehended
within its destructive range almost the whole
surface of the country, had consumed a large portion of
the fragments of wood, which, intermixed with earth,
forms the exterior wall of their mounds; these the emmets
were now unremittingly employed in replacing, with
half-burned sticks, which were sought for in every direction.
Verdure was appearing in favourable situations,
and the ash was in full bloom, which tree, associated with
the elm and willow, comprehends the chief portion of the
few trees that were here seen. In the night we were
awakened by a heavy fall of rain, and our attention was
directed to personal safety by tremendous thunder and
lightning, directly in the zenith, and we abandoned our
guns and blankets to take refuge in the open prairie.
This situation was peculiarly uncomfortable; we had been
languid and oppressed by the heat of the sun during the
afternoon's walk, and we were now shivering under the
effects of cold and moisture. In the intervals we kindled
our fire, and became alternately, partially dry, and wet,
as the fall of rain intermitted and recurred.</p>

<p>{70} At the dawn of day we retraced our path, and
found the tent pleasantly situate in an embowered spot,
where three rattle snakes had been killed by the soldier
pitching it. On the following day we descended the creek.</p>

<p>18th. The creek was rapidly subsiding, so that a bridge
constructed by the Omawhaws, which we had passed
almost unobserved, was now two feet above the surface
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
of the water, and rendered it necessary to unload the boat
in order to drag her over. This structure is very simple;
a double series of stout forked pieces of wood are driven
into the bottom of the creek, upon these, poles are laid
transversely, crossed by numerous smaller pieces, which
form a support for dried grass covered by a proper quantity
of earth. What necessity gave rise to the building of this
bridge we know not, and we are inclined to believe, that
bridge-building is a rare effort in our aboriginal architecture.</p>

<p>On the 20th, Major O'Fallon set out on a visit to the
Pawnee villages, accompanied by Captain Riley, Adjutant
Pentland, Lieutenants Talcott and Graham, Mr.
Dougherty and myself, together with a guard of twenty-seven
men, and with seventeen pack and riding horses.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>
In recording the events of this journey, it would be superfluous
to note the appearance of the country over which
we passed, or to describe the magnitude and direction of
the water courses that intersect the route, as this will be
detailed in another part of the work; our attention in the
few following pages will be more particularly directed to
our transactions and interviews with the natives. In the
course of the two following days, we met with several Oto
and Omawhaw Indians, who were occupied with hunting
and trapping. On the 23d we halted a short time with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
a party of the latter nation, headed by a man of much note,
known to the traders by the name of the <i>Voleur</i>,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> the
relics of whose former village, we had previously observed
on Shell Creek.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> {71} Near this stream of water we examined
a great excavation in the brow of a bluff, to which
the name of <i>Pawnee Medicine</i> has been applied, in consequence
of its being an object of superstitious reverence
to the people of that nation. It is evidently an artificial
work, and the product of much labour, being about two
hundred feet long, one hundred and thirty feet wide, and
thirty feet deep. The origin and object of this effort of
savage labour is involved in mystery, and the Pawnees
cannot, at this day, give any rational history of it; the only
advantage which we can suppose people to have derived
from such a work, is security from the attack of a powerful
enemy. An entire nation may have here defied the efforts
of some allied army of an extensive coalition. We are inclined
to conjecture, that the nation that has left us this
monument of a primitive military art, is no other than the
Rickarees,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> who now reside on the banks of the Missouri,
between the Sioux (Dacota) and Mandan nations, and
who are, beyond a doubt, a branch of the Pawnee stock,
and probably are more immediately descended from that
branch of it, now known as Pawnee Loups. We are led
to this conjecture, however, only from the fact, that ruins
of their former village, apparently coeval with the excavation,
exist within two miles of Beaver Creek.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> In this
vicinity, several antelopes (Cervicapra Americana, Ord)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
were seen by the party, but they were so shy and swift, that
it was not possible to kill one of them.</p>

<p>On the succeeding day, a large body of Indians was
observed in the distance moving towards us, which proved
to be the principal portion of the Oto nation, who were
now returning to their own village, from a trading visit to
the Pawnees. We here met with numerous acquaintances,
who saluted us cordially, although they appeared somewhat
jealous of our visit to the Pawnees. The Little
Soldier rode up with great animation, and communicated
to some {72} of us, by means of signs, an intimation that a
glorious battle had been fought by a party of Pawnee
Loups, in which the greater part of them had been killed,
and nearly all the remainder of them wounded.</p>

<p>We resumed our journey, and at the distance of two or
three miles observed numerous horses grazing over the
plain, squaws occupied in pitching skin lodges, and men
advancing to meet us; they were soon recognized for
Omawhaws, and informed us that they were engaged in
hunting. We were soon joined by the Big-horse, Crenier,
and other chiefs and warriors of the Oto and Omawhaw
nations, who remained a considerable time, and received
a small present of tobacco at parting.</p>

<p>At Willow Creek,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> several Pawnees were observed on
the opposite side at a distance, who avoided us, and as we
continued on during the afternoon, many of them appeared
at different times and places, on the bluffs, which, at a
little distance, bounded our route to the right; but, like
the first we had seen, they would not approach our party,
but retired on our advancing towards them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>The evening encampment was pitched at a favourable
position, on the bank of the Loup Fork, where we found
a boy guarding horses; he had a melancholy air, and his
appearance interested us much; a number of squaws had
fled at our approach, but he remained unmoved. He
invited us to continue onward to the village, stating
the probability of a fall of rain on the coming night. "Are
you not afraid," we asked, "to remain here all day, at such
a distance from your village?" "No," said he, with the
utmost indifference; "the Sioux have not been here this
long time past, but I saw a great many men and horses
to-day on the opposite side of the river: they may have
been Sioux: I don't know." Being presented with a
biscuit, he ate part of it, and put the remainder in his belt
for his parents, that they might taste of the food of the
white people.</p>

<p>{73} In the evening Semino, a Canadian interpreter residing
with the Pawnees, arrived with a letter from Mr.
Papan,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> (a trader in the nation,) stating, that as some
misunderstanding had occurred amongst the chiefs, Tarrarecawaho
had declined meeting the party, to escort us
into the village, as he had previously intended to do.</p>

<p>This conduct of the chief was altogether unexpected,
inasmuch as he had invited the agent, at the autumnal
council, to visit his village, and requested him to halt his
party at some distance, and inform him of his proximity,
that he might be received with due ceremony. Major
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
O'Fallon, immediately perceiving the necessity of supporting
the dignity of his mission in the eyes of these Indians,
in order the more effectually to command their respect,
directed the messengers to return forthwith and tell that
chief, that "he must consider well whom he is about to receive;
if he will not meet me in a proper manner, I will
pass through his village, without looking at him or his
people, and visit the next village, and so on to the third;
and if I shall not be properly treated at either, I will return
to Camp Missouri to count the graves of the soldiers whom
he has heard died there." No further communication
was received respecting the intentions of the great chief,
and early on the succeeding morning our journey was
resumed.</p>

<p>After riding a considerable distance over a beautiful
plain, we came in view of the village of the Grand Pawnees,
and saw in every direction great numbers of horses and
mules, and a few asses attended by men and boys. At
some distance on the left, the Loup Fork meandered, on
the bank of which stream was a long line of squaws bearing
{74} heavy burdens of fuel towards the village. A chief
was soon observed advancing with rapidity; he was received
by our cavalcade with music playing, and flags
displayed, and was recognized to be Sharitarish, eldest
son of the chief of that name commemorated by Lieutenant
Pike, and now second chief of the Grand Pawnees; the
interpreters being absent, no particular communication
was interchanged, and we moved on.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> A short time,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
however, only elapsed before Tarrarecawaho approached
in full dress. We could not choose but admire the lofty
dignity of his appearance; but his extreme hauteur became
manifest when he halted at the head of our line, by
not offering his hand, or even deigning to look at us. This
deportment was reciprocated, and we moved onward again
without particularly noticing him, excepting by the short
intermission of movements which had taken place, we were
soon informed from the rear, that the Grand Chief was
making signs to induce us to halt; but finding that his imperious
deportment gained no respect, and that his present
request was altogether disregarded, he at once relinquished
the high grounds which he had seemed anxious to maintain,
and riding forward, he condescended to offer his
hand to each of us in succession.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> The interpreters having
rejoined the party, Major O'Fallon was enabled to communicate
with the chief and principal men, such as Taritiwishta,
chief of the Tappage band, Ishcatappa, brother
of Sharetarish, and others, who successively arrived. He
then addressed Tarrarecawaho briefly thus: "Long Hair,
I have come to visit you agreeably to your invitation, and
desire to know whether or not you are glad to see me."
The chief answered, "That I am glad to see you, the display
of these medals on my dress, and those flags of your
nation which are waving in my village, will amply testify."
He concluded by inviting us to his lodge, but we informed
him that we had brought our own lodges {75} and provisions;
we would, however, accept of his hospitality by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
partaking of his food. We then performed a half circuit
around the village, and entered it with the sound of the
bugle, drum, and fife, with which the commonalty and
children seemed highly delighted, following, or rather
walking beside the musicians obliquely in two extensive
wings, exhibiting the form of the letter V. Of these instruments
the bugle was most decidedly the favourite.
We passed by and saluted the mansions of the chiefs, at
each of which an American flag was hoisted, with the exception
only of one that was passed unnoticed, owing to
its being distinguished by a Spanish flag; which, however,
was struck as soon as the cause of the procedure was understood.
This ceremony being performed, the men were
marched off to encamp, and we entered the dwelling of the
Grand Chief. After partaking of some excellent boiled
bison meat, he requested to know if we would condescend
to eat at the houses of the warriors; but the agent informed
him that we could only accept of the hospitality of chiefs.
We were then conducted to six other feasts, in immediate
succession, after which we retired to the encampment that
had been formed in a low prairie near the town.</p>

<p>During our stay in Tarrarecawaho's lodge, Major
O'Fallon spoke at some length to that chief. He informed
him that thus far he was pleased with the reception he had
given us; that he had come to repeat in the village, the
same words that had been uttered at Engineer Cantonment,
&amp;c. The manner as well as the matter of the address,
seemed to command undivided attention; every eye
was riveted upon the speaker, and the most profound
silence reigned throughout a crowded audience, that preserved
a respectful distance behind the chiefs that were
seated directly before us.</p>

<p>Instead of an immediate reply, Tarrarecawaho, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
alone had remained standing, addressed his {76} warriors
in a loud, fluent, and impassionate manner: "I am the
only individual of this nation, that possesses a knowledge
of the manners and power of the whites. I have been to
the town of the Red Head, (Governor Clarke, at St. Louis,)
and saw there all that a red skin could see. Here sits a
chief, (pointing to the agent,) who controls every thing in
this land; if he should prohibit you from wearing breech-cloths,
you could not wear them. You know that we cannot
dispense with powder and balls; you must also know
that we cannot dispense with this chief, as he can prevent
us from obtaining them. I have no personal fear; I only
dread the consequence of improper conduct, to the women
and children; take pity on your women and children,
warriors. When he tells you that he is a chief, he speaks
truly; when he says that his soldiers appear like the grass
in the spring, in place of those who die, he speaks truly;
you, my nation, are like the fly in strength, just so easily
can his mighty nation crush you between their fingers.
Young men, I have done; to morrow I will invite the
American chief to council, and if any of you wish to speak
to him then, you have my consent. Do as I do; I am not
ashamed of what I have done; follow my example."</p>

<p>He then, in a mild tone and polite manner, informed the
agent that he would consult his chiefs, and would return
an answer to his speech to-morrow.</p>

<p>Accordingly, about noon on the 26th, a messenger arrived
with information that the chiefs and warriors were
ready to receive the agent, and we repaired to the lodge
in which the assembly was convened. They formed a
circle round the chamber, sitting on grass mats; the
chiefs occupied the back part of the lodge, directly in
front of whom we were invited to be seated, on mats
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
spread for our reception. A profound silence ensued,
during which the eyes of the assembly were occasionally
turned by a glance upon {77} Tarrarecawaho, who at
length arose, and after a short harangue, held his pipe to
the Major to smoke, signifying that he presented a horse.
Several speakers succeeded, who generally presented the
pipe in the same manner. After an address from Major
O'Fallon, who concluded by inviting the principal men to
our camp, to present them with "a pipe of tobacco," the
council dissolved.</p>

<p>On the expiration of two or three hours, the chiefs and
warriors appeared at our camp, and seated themselves on
robes and blankets, before our tent, whilst several hundred
of the people encompassed us, keeping, however, at a
respectful distance. When the agent had terminated some
appropriate observations, he deposited before Tarrarecawaho,
Sharetarish, and the Tappage chief, the presents he
intended to make, in as many separate parcels. A difference
having for some time existed between the two first-mentioned
chiefs, the former, who was in fault, having
threatened to chastise the other, and on being challenged
by him, refused to decide the controversy by single combat,
now availed himself of a favourable opportunity to obtain a
reconciliation, by presenting to Sharetarish his entire parcel
of merchandize: Sharetarish then proceeded to parcel
out his double portion, consisting of fusils, powder and
ball, strouding, blankets, calico, &amp;c. amongst the multitude,
reserving nothing for himself. He laid a portion at the
feet of Tarrarecawaho, and this chief again performed the
part of a donor, retaining only a United States' flag, and
expressed his satisfaction and thanks to the agent, for the
merchandize they had received. Sharetarish said, that,
if agreeable to his father, (Major O'Fallon,) he would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
return in a reasonable time, and bring some of his young
warriors, for the purpose of performing a dance.</p>

<p>Towards evening, Sharetarish arrived with his dancers,
thirty or forty in number, who were all accoutred and
painted for the occasion. This exhibition, {78} which
would have appeared to us to partake much of the terrific,
did we not feel assured of their pacific disposition, bore considerable
resemblance to that performed by the Otoes at
Engineer Cantonment, already described, excepting that
less pantomimic action was used, and <i>striking the post</i>
formed no part of the ceremony. At the termination of
the dance, Sharetarish presented Major O'Fallon with a
painted bison robe, representing several of his own combats
with the enemy, as well as those of his friends, all of
which he explained to us.</p>

<p>27th. The tents were struck, and we departed for the
village of the Pawnee Loups. At the distance of four
miles, we passed the Republican village, about a mile on
our left; from thence the distance is about three miles to
the Loup village, over a beautiful bottom plain of the
width of a mile and a half, extending along the Loup fork
of the Platte. This plain is nearly thirty feet lower than
that over which we had travelled, and which terminates
abruptly at the Grand Pawnee village. When within two
miles of the village of the Loups, a messenger requested
the party to halt, in order to give the chiefs the requisite
time to make their preparations to receive us in a manner
suitable to the representative of a nation "so great and
powerful as that of the Big-knives."</p>

<p>After waiting a short time, we observed, at the distance
of a mile before us, a great number of mounted Indians
emerging suddenly, apparently from the plain itself, for we
could not then see a ravine that had previously concealed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
them from our view. They immediately began to ride in
various directions, and to perform numerous evolutions,
until the whole were arranged in a widely-extended line.
These rapid movements, which attracted our attention
from other objects, having ceased, we perceived a small
body of men in front, whose movements were independent
of the others, and who were advancing at a moderate pace.
When all were formed, they set forwards, {79} slowly at
first, but gradually increasing their speed as they approached,
until they surrounded us at a full charge. It is
impossible by description to do justice to the scene of savage
magnificence that was now displayed. Between three
and four hundred mounted Indians, dressed in their richest
habiliments of war, were rushing around us in every
direction, with streaming feathers, war weapons, and with
loud shouts and yells. The few whom we had observed
in advance of the main body, and whom, as they came near,
we recognized to be the chief men, presented a perfect
contrast to the others in their slow movements, and simplicity
of dress. Courtesy obliged us to shake hands with
each individual, as they came to us in succession for that
purpose, nor was a single soldier of our train forgotten on
this occasion by any one of them. They expressed great
satisfaction on account of our visit, rubbing their breasts
in token of the sincerity of this pleasure. Many remarked
that the nation had been mourning for their grievous losses
in a recent battle with an enemy, but that now grief should
give place to rejoicing. Major O'Fallon addressed the
Indians as usual, after which we again moved on towards
the village. Latelesha, the grand chief, perceiving that
the division of his warriors that were on our left, raised
some dust on the march, ordered them all to leeward, that
we might not be incommoded. Almost from the beginning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
of this interesting f&ecirc;te, our attention had been attracted
to a young man who seemed to be the leader or
partizan of the warriors. He was about twenty-three years
of age, of the finest form, tall, muscular, exceedingly graceful,
and of a most prepossessing countenance. His head
dress of war eagles' feathers, descended in a double series
upon his back like wings, to his saddle croup; his shield
was highly decorated, and his long lance was ornamented
by a plaited casing of red and blue cloth. On inquiring
of the interpreter, our admiration was augmented by learning
{80} that he was no other than Petalesharoo, with
whose name and character we were already familiar. He
is the most intrepid warrior of the nation, eldest son of
Latelesha, destined as well by mental and physical qualifications,
as by his distinguished birth, to be the future
leader of his people. Seeing that his father had taken a
place in our cavalcade on the left of Major O'Fallon, he
rode up on his right to the exclusion of a brave officer who
had previously occupied that situation, and who now regarded
him with an apparently stern aspect, but in
which there was perhaps more of admiration than of
irritation at this unexpected intrusion. The young chief
caught the look, and retorted with an eye that seemed
never to have been averted through fear. The name of
Petalesharoo is connected with the abolition of a custom
formerly prevalent in this nation, at which humanity
shudders.</p>

<p>The Pawnee Loups heretofore exhibited the singular
anomaly, amongst the American natives, of a people addicted
to the inhuman, superstitious rite, of making propitiatory
offerings of human victims to Venus, the <i>Great
Star</i>. The origin of this sanguinary sacrifice is unknown;
probably it existed previously to their intercourse with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
white traders. This solemn ceremony was performed
annually, and immediately preceded their horticultural
operations, for the success of which it appears to have
been instituted. A breach of this duty, the performance
of which they believed to be required by the Great Star,
it was supposed would be succeeded by the total failure
of their crops of maize, beans, and pumpkins, and the
consequent total privation of their vegetable food.</p>

<p>To obviate a national calamity so formidable, any person
was at liberty to offer up a prisoner of either sex, that
by his prowess in war he had become possessed of.</p>

<p>{81} The devoted individual was clothed in the gayest
and most costly attire; profusely supplied with the choicest
food, and constantly attended by the magi, who anticipated
all his wants, cautiously concealed from him the real object
of their sedulous attentions, and endeavoured to preserve
his mind in a state of cheerfulness, with the view of promoting
obesity, and thereby rendering the sacrifice more
acceptable to their Ceres.</p>

<p>When the victim was thus sufficiently fattened for their
purpose, a suitable day was appointed for the performance
of the rite, that the whole nation might attend.</p>

<p>The victim was bound to a cross, in presence of the
assembled multitude, when a solemn dance was performed,
and after some other ceremonies, the warrior, whose prisoner
he had been, cleaved his head with the tomahawk;
and his speedy death was insured by numerous archers,
who penetrated his body with their arrows.</p>

<p>A trader informed us that the squaws cut pieces of flesh
from the deceased, with which they greased their hoes;
but this was denied by another, who had been present at
one of these sacrifices. However this may be, the ceremony
was believed to have called down a blessing upon their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
labours of the field, and they proceeded to planting without
delay.</p>

<p>The present mild and humane chief of the nation, Latelesha,
or Knife Chief, had long regarded this sacrifice as an
unnecessary and cruel exhibition of power, exercised upon
unfortunate and defenceless individuals, whom they were
bound to protect; and he vainly endeavoured to abolish it
by philanthropic admonitions.</p>

<p>An Ietan woman, who was brought captive into the village,
was doomed to the Great Star by the warrior, whose
property she had become by the fate of war. She underwent
the usual preparations, and, on the appointed day,
was led to the cross, amidst a {82} great concourse of people,
as eager, perhaps, as their civilized fellow men, to
witness the horrors of an execution. The victim was
bound to the cross with thongs of skin, and the usual ceremonies
being performed, her dread of a more terrible death
was about to be terminated by the tomahawk and the arrow.
At this critical juncture, Petalesharoo (son of the Knife
Chief) stepped forward into the area, and in a hurried but
firm manner, declared that it was his father's wish to abolish
this sacrifice; that for himself, he had presented himself
before them, for the purpose of laying down his life
upon the spot, or of releasing the victim. He then cut the
cords which bound her to the cross, carried her swiftly
through the crowd to a horse, which he presented to her,
and having mounted another himself, he conveyed her
beyond the reach of immediate pursuit; when, after having
supplied her with food, and admonishing her to make the
best of her way to her own nation, which was at a distance
of at least four hundred miles, he was constrained to return
to his village. The emancipated Ietan had, however, the
good fortune, on her journey of the subsequent day, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
meet with a war party of her own people, by whom she was
conveyed to her family in safety.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>This daring deed would, almost to a certainty, have
terminated in an unsuccessful attempt, under the arm of
any other warrior; and Petalesharoo was, no doubt, indebted
for this successful and noble achievement to the
distinguished renown which his feats of chivalry had already
gained for him, and which commanded the high respect
of all his rival warriors. Notwithstanding the signal
success of this enterprise, another display of the firmness
and determination of the young warrior was required to
abolish this sacrifice, it is to be hoped for ever. The succeeding
spring, a warrior, who had captured a fine Spanish
boy, vowed to sacrifice him to the Great {83} Star, and
accordingly placed him under the care of the magi, for
that purpose.</p>

<p>The Knife Chief, learning the determination of the warrior,
consulted with his son, respecting the best means of
preventing a repetition of the horrible ceremony. "I will
rescue the boy," said Petalesharoo, "as a warrior should,
by force;" but the Knife Chief, unwilling that his son
should again expose himself to a danger so imminent, as
that which he had once encountered in this cause, hoped
to compel the warrior to exchange his victim for a large
quantity of merchandize, which he would endeavour to
obtain with that view. For this purpose he repaired to Mr.
Pappan, who happened to be in the village for the purposes
of trade, and communicated to him his intentions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
Mr. Pappan generously contributed a considerable quantity
of merchandize, and much was added by himself,
by Petalesharoo, and other Indians.</p>

<p>All this treasure was laid in a heap together, in the lodge
of the Knife Chief, who thereupon summoned the warrior
before him. The chief armed himself with his war-club,
and explained the object of his call, commanding the warrior
to accept the merchandize and yield up the boy, or
prepare for instant death. The warrior refused, and the
chief waved his club in the air towards the warrior.
"Strike," said Petalesharoo, who stood near to support
his father; "I will meet the vengeance of his friends."
But the more prudent and politic chief added a few more
articles to the mass of merchandize, in order to give the
warrior another opportunity of acquiescing without forfeiting
his word.</p>

<p>This expedient succeeded; the goods were reluctantly
accepted, and the boy was liberated, and was subsequently
conducted to St. Louis by the traders. The merchandize
was sacrificed in place of the boy; the cloth was cut in
shreds, and suspended by poles at the place of sacrifice,
and many {84} of the valuables were consumed by fire. It
is not expected that another attempt will be made to immolate
a human victim, during the life of Petalesharoo,
or of his benign father.</p>

<p>Our cavalcade performed a circuit round the village,
and saluted at the lodge of Latelesha, upon which the flag
of the United States was hoisted; the soldiers were then
marched to a proper encampment place, and we were feasted
as before. Great order prevailed in this village, and
silence reigned throughout, which was attributed to their
loss of friends and kinsmen.</p>

<p>On the following day the council was held, at which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
eleven horses and mules were presented in the usual manner.
In two instances, however, the horse was represented
by a cord or halter attached to a stick. One of these cords
was drawn by a little Ietan girl, that Petalesharoo had
captured in some battle and adopted as his daughter; she
seemed to be the favourite of his family.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the greater part of the population were
observed coming from the village towards our camp. As
they drew near, we ascertained that many were painted,
armed, and decorated as if for war. Petalesharoo advanced,
and gave notice that he had brought some of his
warriors, for the purpose of honouring his American father
with a dance. The dancers were about forty in number,
and their movements and evolutions were similar to those
of the Grand Pawnees. The deep-toned gong was so entirely
concealed in the centre of the mass of dancers, that
it was with difficulty we ascertained whence the wild and
measured sound proceeded, which regulated their simultaneous
movements. It was accompanied by other simple
instruments, and occasionally interrupted from the ear
by the piercing note of the whistle, or the sudden discharge
of a gun, with the muzzle directed to the earth. At the
termination of the first dance, the partizan requested {85}
the accompaniment of our music for the succeeding dance.
The music accordingly struck up, with the renewed beating
of the gong; but it immediately threw them all into confusion,
and after vainly endeavouring to regain their regularity,
they ceased. Again the experiment was tried, and
again it produced inextricable confusion. This repeated
result brought a smile to the countenance of the partizan,
who expressed his conviction, that his party was
unable to dance to the music of the white people.</p>

<p>The principal men having now arrived, agreeably to invitation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
they were introduced into a large skin lodge which
had been erected for us by the orders of Latelesha, as our
marquee was too feeble to resist a strong wind which prevailed
during the day. Presents were made to Latelesha
and the Metiff chief. The latter transferred his parcel to
Latelesha, who laid the whole before Petalesharoo, to
dispose of as he thought proper. The young chief appointed
two persons to distribute them; and thus the whole
was disposed of, though very unequally. The chiefs then
returned their thanks and withdrew.</p>

<p>I passed the night at the lodge of the Metiff chief, and
in the evening was amused by the exhibition of another
dancing party, who concluded by inviting the chief to partake
of a feast, to be given on the following day, for the
purpose of dispelling his grief for the loss of his brother,
in the late contest with the Indians of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>This severe battle was fought by ninety-three Pawnee
Loup warriors, against a large body of Ietans, Arrapahoes
and Kiawas.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>The party was led by the most distinguished brave of
the village, and half brother of the Metiff chief, but of unmixed
blood, and a principal supporter of the influence of
that chief. The party, who were all on foot, were on their
way to capture horses, but they were badly armed for a
contest, and had but {86} twelve guns amongst them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
They were proceeding cautiously along in the prairies
between the head waters of the Arkansa and the Rio del
Norte, when one party of their runners, or discoverers,
came in with information that a great body of the enemy
were ahead, and had not seen them; another party of runners
soon came in with the same information. The whole
now halted to wait for night to capture horses, and busied
themselves in preparing their ropes and halters, and in
putting themselves in the best order in case of attack.
One of the party ascended a small eminence, and perceived
three of the enemy mounted and coming on in full career;
presently more appeared, and soon after they began to
show themselves in every quarter. It was now evident
to the party, that the enemy were the first discoverers, and
that they were now necessitated to contend against a vastly
superior force, better armed than themselves, and possessing
also the advantage of being all mounted on good horses.
It was obvious also that there was no hope for them, but
in the display of desperate valour. Their first wish had
been to gain a creek at some distance in the rear, which
was margined with small timber; but as their enemy now
completely surrounded them, this was impossible. The
battle commenced about ten o'clock <small>A. M.</small>, and soon raged
with great fury. Every muscle was called into action in
our little band, who hung firmly together, discharging
their arrows and occasionally a fusee at the enemy with
the steadiest aim. The dead and wounded were falling
in every direction in both parties. The enemy were so
numerous that numbers of their braves, armed only with
a shield, having rejected their offensive weapons, hovered
in front of their companions, intent only' upon the acquisition
of the renown dearest to the heart of the warrior, that
of first striking the body of a fallen enemy; many of them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
however were killed, even by their own people, as they
rushed along and intercepted the flight of the {87} arrow
or bullet from its destined mark. The combatants were
at very close quarters, and the arrow had its full effect.
They were for some time intermingled, and contended
with their war-clubs and knives. The partizan, who had
been wounded severely early in the action, and had received
several more wounds during its continuance, now
was struck by an arrow, which buried itself to the feathers
in his body. He knew the wound was a mortal one, and
fell, but supported himself upon the ground to encourage
his men; "My braves," said he, "fight whilst you can
move a limb, and when your arrows are expended take
your knives." Looking around now upon his companions
in arms, he perceived that nearly all his principal braves
were killed or disabled, and with his dying words he ordered
those who were still on their feet to pierce the surrounding
enemy, and endeavour to save themselves in the timber
of the creek. As soon as it was ascertained that their partizan
was dead, his orders were carried into effect; and
the remnant of the party fought their way to the creek,
where the enemy abandoned them, and returned to exult
over the slain. One only of the principal braves was left
in this shattered band; he declared he was ashamed that he
had survived, and he immediately ran back to the enemy,
although much wounded, and was seen no more. The
party now found that they had left fifty-three men dead,
or disabled, on the battle ground, amongst whom were all
their braves, who had exposed themselves to danger more
than the others. Of their numbers, now diminished to
forty, all were wounded, with the exception of seven only,
and some of these very desperately; one individual had
eight different wounds. As they had thrown off their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
robes, breech-cloths, and leggings, at the commencement
of the battle, they were now absolutely naked, and the
weather was extremely cold. They made rude cars on
which they drew along those who could not walk; and thus
{88} they commenced and proceeded in their slow and
laborious march to their village. During the journey some
of the wounded requested to be killed, or left to die alone;
and one who was wounded in the knee, after soliciting
death from his brother repeatedly in vain, sought an opportunity
to die, and finally plunged his knife in his heart.
The party subsisted by killing a few bisons on the way, and
partially clothed themselves with their raw hides; a miserable
defence against the intensity of the cold.</p>

<p>The Grand Pawnees were more successful in war excursions
during the winter. One of their parties encountered
a party of Spaniards, who, my informant asserted, sought
safety in flight. But it seems highly probable that a battle
took place, and that many were killed; inasmuch as the
victors returned with much clothing, merchandize, very
handsome figured blankets, many horses, and some silver
money. I was almost confirmed in this belief, by being
subsequently informed that the party had certainly brought
with them some scalps which were not those of Indians;
and on passing through the village, I thought that some
of the hair which streamed in the wind from numerous
portions of human scalps, suspended on sticks from the
roofs of the lodges, was taken from the heads of Spaniards.</p>

<p>These three bands or clans of Pawnees, although they
harmonize well together at present, are not exempt from
the lot of artificial distinctions; and party animosity sometimes
occurs, which, in one instance, had nearly produced
fatal consequences. The Puncaw Indians, having conceived
themselves injured by the Pawnee Loups, applied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
to the Grand Pawnees for aid in obtaining redress. The
latter warmly espoused their cause, and the Grand Chief
marched his warriors towards the Loup village, in avowed
hostility. Petalesharoo hastily assembled his warriors
for defence, and sallied out to meet the enemy; but finding
their numerical force to be greatly superior{89} to his own,
he saw that the resistance which his little band could offer,
though it might check their career, would, in all probability,
be insufficient to repel them. He therefore rode forward
between the parties, and called aloud on Tarrarecawaho,
who then advanced to meet him. The young chief
immediately challenged him to a single combat; let us, said
he, thus avoid the copious effusion of kindred blood, which
otherwise must flow upon the earth in a general battle.
This proposition was peremptorily refused. Then, said
Petalesharoo, I must call you an old squaw, and a coward;
return to your party and select for me the bravest of your
men. This being also refused, Latelesha came forward,
and by amicable negociation adjusted the point in dispute.
This village contains about one hundred and forty-five
lodges.</p>

<p>29th. The horses that were <i>smoked</i> yesterday were
brought this morning, and we departed on our return by
way of the Republican village. When within a mile of
the latter, we were again halted by a messenger, in order
that the warriors might prepare to receive us properly. In
about an hour they were seen issuing from the village, with
four chiefs in front, who lamented aloud as they came near,
in token of penitence for their offences. They proceeded
to shake us by the hand, whilst about one hundred and
fifty mounted, decorated, and painted warriors were rushing
about us in every direction, whooping and yelling, and
exhibiting such gracefulness and safety of riding as we had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
never before witnessed, excepting at the Loup village, of
which the present display was nearly a counterpart in
miniature. In this sham attack, the partizan performed
the part of our defender, hovering near us, and as the
warriors charged upon us, he intercepted and repelled
them. I expected to recognize amongst these warriors
many of the individuals who had composed the war party
that we encountered near the Konza village. I therefore
scrutinizingly examined{90} the countenance and figure
of each one as they successively offered their hands. But
although I had on that occasion particularly noted the
features of several of the war party, for the purpose of
identifying them on a future time, I could now recognize
but a single individual. I knew him immediately, and
judging from the Indian character, he knew me equally
well; yet his physiognomy, on presenting me his hand,
was not varied in the slightest degree from the expression
with which he regarded my companions, many of whom
he had not before seen.</p>

<p>After saluting at the village as before, we were invited
into the lodge of Fool Robe, the principal chief, an old man
of about eighty years, destitute of any thing remarkable in
his appearance. The chief men being assembled, the
council was immediately held. Major O'Fallon arose,
and spoke at considerable length, informing them of the
great power of the United States; he detailed the glaring
offences of the Pawnee Republicans, and concluded by
offering them peace or war, though neither of these was
solicited in preference. The chief men, in reply, manifested
a great desire to adjust all differences, and promised
to conduct themselves better in future. Fool Robe spoke
well, but with evident embarrassment. They lamented
their poverty, which prevented them from presenting more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
than four horses, sixteen bison robes, and a package of
dried meat. A chief of this nation, called Petalesharoo,
who promised, at Engineer cantonment, to chastise the
offenders, having neglected to execute this act of justice,
retired from the village on our approach. The agent, on
this account, declared to the council, that he wished never
to see him again; that he did not consider him a brave man,
as he was afraid to comply with his promise; and that if
he ever should meet with him in council, he would compel
him to sit with the young men. The council{91} was
further assured, that the offences, which the young men
of this nation had committed against white people, would
be forgiven, but not forgotten. We had to regret the absence
of the son of Fool Robe, a fine intelligent young man,
who was engaged on some predatory excursion, at the head
of one hundred and sixty warriors.</p>

<p>During the night a Konza war party carried off one
hundred and forty horses from the village.</p>

<p>The following day we returned to the village of the
Grand Pawnees, and received the horses that had been
presented at the council by the ceremony of the pipe. A
quantity of merchandize had been brought with us from
Camp Missouri, to exchange for horses for the service of
the troops. This was put into the hands of Messrs. Pappan
and Dougherty for that purpose; and we retired to
our camp, which was upon the same spot as that we occupied
on the night of the 24th instant.</p>

<p>May 1st. Mr. Pappan and Mr. Dougherty arrived from
the village, having purchased nineteen horses and mules.
The price of the horses and mules averaged about the
amount of thirty dollars in Indian merchandize, estimated
at the St. Louis valuation.</p>

<p>At each of the villages we observed small sticks, of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
length of eighteen inches or two feet, painted red, stuck in
the earth in various situations, but chiefly on the roofs of
the houses, each bearing the fragment of a human scalp,
the hair of which streamed in the wind. Before the entrance
to some of the lodges were small frames, like painters'
easels, supporting each a shield, and generally a large
painted cylindrical case of skin, prepared like parchment,
in which a war dress is deposited. The shield is circular,
made of bison skin, and thick enough to ward off an arrow;
but not to arrest the flight of a rifle ball at close quarters.</p>

<p>Defended by this shield, a warrior will not hesitate to
cross the path of an arrow; he will sometimes {92} dexterously
seize the missile after it has struck, and discharge it
back again at the enemy.</p>

<p>The lodges or houses of these three villages are similar
in structure, but differ in size. The description of those
of the Konzas will apply to them, excepting that the beds
are all concealed by a mat partition, which extends parallel
to the walls of the lodge, and from the floor to the roof.
Small apertures, or doors, at intervals in this partition, are
left for the different families that inhabit a lodge to enter
their respective bed chambers.</p>

<p>In the evening Major O'Fallon presented each of us
with a horse.</p>

<p>Several Indians came to our camp for the purpose of
trading with the men. Major O'Fallon wished to obtain
one of their horses, in exchange for one that he possessed;
but the Indian modestly declined, saying, "My father, the
horse you offer was given by my brother, which is the same
as if I had given him myself; I will exchange for almost
any other horse."</p>

<p>Early on the following morning we departed on our return
to the Missouri, with a numerous retinue of horses,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
amounting to more than sixty. On the way several bisons
were killed, and three calves were taken alive in the chase,
by throwing nooses over their heads.</p>

<p>On the 6th we arrived at the Missouri, after an absence
of sixteen days. Much of the information we acquired,
respecting the manners, &amp;c. of the Pawnees, is incorporated
in the account of the Indians of the Missouri, in some
of the preceding chapters of this work.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII_V">{93} CHAPTER VII {V}</h2>

<p class="hang">Journey by Land from St. Louis to Council Bluff—Grand
River—Plains at the Sources of the Little Platte, the
Nishnebottona, &amp;c.—Departure of the Expedition from
Engineer Cantonment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the transactions above detailed were passing,
Major Long had returned from the seat of government.</p>

<p>On the 24th of April 1820, he arrived at St. Louis, on
his way from Philadelphia to Council Bluff, to rejoin the
party. He was accompanied by Captain John R. Bell,
attached to the exploring Expedition by order from the
War Department, and by Dr. E. James, who had been
appointed to serve as botanist and geologist, in consequence
of recommendations from the Honourable Secretary of
the Navy, from Dr. Torrey and Captain Le Conte.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<p>Having procured horses, and equipped ourselves for a
journey in the wilderness, we left St. Louis on the 4th of
May, intending to proceed by the most direct route across
the country to Council Bluff.</p>

<p>The lands immediately in the rear of St. Louis, between
the Mississippi and the Missouri, below their junction,
have an undulated surface, and a deep alluvial soil. Since
their occupation by permanent inhabitants, the yearly
ravages of fire have been prevented, and a dense growth
of oaks and elms has sprung up.</p>

<p>In this fact we have a satisfactory explanation of the
cause of the present want of forest trees in extensive tracts
on the Missouri, which appear, in every respect, adapted
to the growth of timber. If these lands, called prairies,
were at any former period covered with forests, it may
easily be supposed, the {94} yearly devastations of fires
breaking out in dry seasons would destroy many of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
trees. The forests being thus broken, the growth of
grasses and annual plants would be greatly facilitated by
the nakedness of the soil, and the free admission of the
rays of the sun. Forests attract rain, and impede evaporation;
while the reverberation from the surface of vast
plains, and deserts, tends to dissipate the clouds and
vapours which are driven over them by the winds. In
fertile districts like the alluvial lands of the Missouri and
Mississippi, a heavy annual growth of herbaceous plants is
produced, which, after the autumnal frosts, becomes dry
and peculiarly adapted to facilitate and extend the ravages
of fire. In a country occupied by hunters, who are kindling
their camp fires in every part of the forest, and who often,
like the Mongalls in the grassy deserts of Asia, set fire to
the plains, in order to attract herbivorous animals, by the
growth of tender and nutritious herbage which springs up
soon after the burning, it is easy to see these annual conflagrations
could not fail to happen.</p>

<p>In the Autumn of 1819, the burnings, owing to the
unusual drought, continued until very late in the season;
so that the weeds in the low grounds were consumed, to
the manifest injury of the forests. Large bodies of timber
are so frequently destroyed in this way, that the appearance
has become familiar to hunters and travellers, and
has received the name of <i>deadening</i>.</p>

<p>After the burning of the grass in the open prairies, the
wind, which at that season usually blows with great strength
from the north-west, carries off the ashes from the general
surface into the hollows and small vallies, thus contributing
to enrich the latter at the expense of the former.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

<p>The prairie appears to have heretofore extended, {95}
almost without interruption, for several miles in the rear
of St. Louis. The western portions of it are yet naked
meadows, without trees or bushes. As we followed the
little pathway towards Bon Homme,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> we passed large
tracts to which the labours of the sand rat<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> had given the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
aspect of a ploughed field. From the great quantities of
fresh earth recently brought up, we perceived the little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
animals were engaged in enlarging their subterranean
excavations; and we watched long, though in vain, expecting
to see them emerge from their burrows. It is
probable the jarring of the earth under the hoofs of our
horses, by giving early notice of our approach, prevented
them from appearing at the surface.</p>

<p>In our way we passed the large hepatic spring visited by
Mr. Jessup, and described in his report. It rises in the
bed of a large brook, and diffuses a strong sulphurous
odour, perceptible at a distance of one hundred yards.
It probably derives its mineral impregnation from some
decomposition in the alluvial substances through which
it rises to the surface.</p>

<p>Eight or ten miles west of St. Louis, forests of oak and
hickory begin to occur, and become more frequent towards
Chesterfield and Bon Homme.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> At evening we descended
into the deep cotton-wood forests of the Missouri bottom,
and a little before sunset arrived on the bank of that majestic
river. Here we were politely received and entertained
in the house of a gentleman formerly of New York.
A large and splendid collection of books, several articles
of costly furniture, and above all, manners and conversation
like those of the better classes in our cities, formed
here a striking contrast to the rude and solitary cabin, and
the wild features of nature, in a spot where the labours of
men had as yet produced scarce a perceptible change.</p>

<p>On the ensuing morning, May 5th, we crossed the Missouri
above Bon Homme. The forests on the {96} north
side of the Missouri were here narrow, and confined principally
to the vallies.</p>

<p>Pond Fort, where we halted to dine, was at this time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
the residence of a single family. In the late war, the
inhabitants of the surrounding country had collected their
families and their cattle at this place, building their
temporary residences in the form of a hollow square,
within which their cattle and horses were enclosed at
night.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>In the pond, which lies along the north side of the fort,
the nelumbium was growing in great perfection. Its
broad orbicular leaves are somewhat raised from the
water, almost concealing its surface. Its showy yellow
flower, when fully expanded, is larger, as remarked by
Nuttall, than that of any other plant indigenous to the
United States, except the magnolia macrophylla. The
nuts, of which there are several immersed in the receptacle
of each flower, have, when ripe, the size and the general
appearance of small acorns, but are much more palatable.
The large farinaceous root is sometimes used by the
Indians as an article of diet, as are also the nuts.</p>

<p>Our path lay through extensive and fertile meadows,
stretching away to the distant horizon, and bounded
sometimes by the verge of the sky, and sometimes by
the margin of a forest. The elk, the deer, and the bison,
the indigenous inhabitants of these delightful meadows,
had been long since driven away by the incursions of the
white settlers, scattered at remote intervals on the borders
of the forests. The dense and uniform growth of grass
had risen untrodden and uncropped, and was now waving
with ceaseless undulations, as the wind swept lightly over
the surface of the plain. The slender and graceful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
panicles of the heuchera americana, rising above the
grass, resembled a grove of spears, bristling above the
heads of an embattled host. Along the margins of the
brooks, we noticed the beautiful spir&aelig;a opulifolia, and
a slender species of {97} viburnum, bending under their
clusters of snowy flowers.</p>

<p>Through the day, the weather had been fine but warm.
At sunset a thunder-storm rose in the west; and the day
was succeeded, almost without any interval of twilight,
by the most impenetrable darkness. The wind soon
rose to a tempest; and hailstones of uncommon magnitude
began to fall, accompanied with thunder and lightning.
Our first thought was to dismount from our horses, and
shelter ourselves from the hail on the leeward side of
their bodies. We were in the middle of an extensive
prairie, where no other protection could be looked for.
The hailstones, however, diminished in size, and soon
ceased to fall; but such torrents of rain ensued, that the
plain became inundated, and the frequent flashes of
lightning were reflected to our eyes from the surface of a
vast lake. The plains in many places having little
inclination, the water of a sudden shower is drained off
less rapidly than it falls. After raging with great violence
for a short time, the storm ceased; but the darkness was
so intense, that we did not arrive at the settlement, where
we proposed to lodge, until a late hour in the night.</p>

<p>Soon after crossing the Missouri, we had ascended so
far as to reach the general level of the great woodless
plain; and after travelling a few miles, we found the surface
sloping to the north-east towards the Mississippi.
In the afternoon, we crossed the Darden, which enters
the Mississippi eight miles above the mouth of the Illinois;
and on the following morning the Cuivre, tributary to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
the same river, ten miles above the other.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> The point
between the Missouri and Mississippi, near their confluence,
is raised in the highest parts, probably less than
one hundred and fifty feet above the water-table. It is
of a deep and fine soil, which would appear rather to
have subsided from the waters of a quiet ocean, than to
have been brought down from above, and deposited {98}
in its present situation by the rivers. Between the sources
of the streams which descend from either side of this
narrow cape, extends an irregular tongue of land, destitute
of timber, and every where nearly of the same elevation;
as if it had been a part of the great plain, left naked at the
retiring of the ocean, and in which the vast vallies of the
Missouri and Mississippi had since been excavated by the
operations of those streams. The smaller rivers of this
region appear, both in extent and direction, to have been
wholly independent of any peculiar conformation of the
original surface on which they commenced their course;
and their present beds gradually deepening, and descending
in the nearest direction towards the vallies of the great
rivers, are in every respect such as we may suppose to
have resulted from the wearing away of a great and
uniform plain. At a house where we rested in the middle
of the day, and which was in the highest part of the
country between the Missouri and Mississippi, here
sixty miles distant from each other, a well had been sunk
sixty-five feet without finding water. This well passes
through several strata of loam, clay, and sand; then
through a narrow horizontal bed, of that peculiar substance
called chalk, by Mr. Schoolcraft;<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> which is here
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
intermixed with numerous angular fragments of flints,
and terminates at the surface of a stratum of blue compact
limestone, abounding in organic remains. We were
informed, that among other things brought up from this
well, were masses of carbonized wood, bearing the marks
of the axe; but as these could not be found, we thought
it reasonable to attribute some part of the account to the
active imagination of the narrator.</p>

<p>From the <i>divide</i> at the sources of the Cuivre, we overlooked
an extensive tract of undulating meadow; and
could distinguish on the distant horizon, the wide valley,
and the extensive forests of Loutre lick.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>{99} This stream is the first deserving notice, which
enters the Missouri from the north. Its sources are
several miles to the north-west of those of the Cuivre.
In its valley the rocky substrata of the plain are exposed,
for an extent of many miles. Near Van Babber's,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
where we arrived a little before sunset on the 6th, there
is, in the middle of the creek, a large brine spring. Over
this has been placed a section of the hollow trunk of a
tree, to prevent the intermixture of the fresh water of the
creek.</p>

<p>The sandstone, from which this spring issues, is granulated
and glimmering, like that about the old lead mines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
of St. Michael.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> Like that, it is in horizontal strata,
and exhibits sufficient evidence of being a continuation
of the same stratum. Perceiving the same indications
of fossil coal, lead, and other minerals here, as were
known to exist in the same range of country on the other
side of the Missouri, we listened with a credulity which
seemed rather to disappoint and surprise our host, to
his account of the phenomena that had appeared from
time to time in his neighbourhood. The combustion of
a coalbed, or the decomposition of a mass of pyrites,
has, we believe, given rise to many more astonishing
stories than he related.</p>

<p>He gave an account of several luminous appearances
that had been seen at the breaking up of winter, or in
unusually rainy seasons, or at other times of the year.
These had been witnessed by many persons of unquestionable
veracity; but so great had been their terror on the
occasion, that they could never afterwards recollect the
precise spot where the light had appeared to them. He
told us of two itinerant preachers, who had encountered
an indescribable phenomenon, at a place about nine
miles east of Loutre lick. As they were riding side by
side at a late hour in the evening, one of them requested
the other to observe a ball of fire attached {100} to the
end of his whip. No sooner was his attention directed
to this object, than a similar one began to appear on the
other end of the whip. In a moment afterwards, their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
horses and all objects near them were enveloped in
wreaths of flame. By this time the minds of the itinerant
preachers were so much confounded, that they were no
longer capable of observation, and could therefore give
no further account of what happened. He also stated as
a fact, authenticated by many credible witnesses, that a
very considerable tract of land near by, had been seen to
send up vast volumes of smoke, which rose through the
light and porous soil, like the smoke through the covering
of a coal-pit. This had in one instance been witnessed
by a son of the celebrated Col. Boon, and was at first
mistaken for a prairie on fire. This phenomenon also
occurs at the breaking up of winter, or at such seasons as
the earth is drenched by uncommon quantities of rain.</p>

<p>Within a few miles of the lick, are eight or nine rude
furnaces, disposed in the direction of a straight line,
extending about two miles. He stated, that it was not
known by whom, or when they were built, nor could it
be ascertained for what purpose. It was evident they
had been used; but no slag cinders or any thing of the
kind had ever been found, nor was it possible to conjecture
for what purpose the furnaces had been constructed.
We regarded all these accounts, and many others of a
similar character, as a sort of traditionary evidence of
the accidental discovery, at some former time, of lead,
coal, or pyrites; and that this discovery, by the ignorance
and credulity of the people, had been magnified into an
object, to which they had at length learned to ascribe a
mysterious and indefinite importance.</p>

<p>Immediately about Loutre lick the surface was rocky
and uneven; low cliffs of light gray sandstone, fringed
with tufts of the dark green pteris atropurpurea, and the
black striped asplenium, overhung {101} the margin of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
the brook, where the inconspicuous flowers of the prinos
l&aelig;vigatus and zanthoxylon fraxineum, and the blue spikes
of the amorpha fruticosa, were just expanding.</p>

<p>Beyond Loutre lick the road traverses longitudinally
that great woodless plain, thirty miles in length, called
the Grand Prairie. It varies in width from one to ten or
fifteen miles. The soil is deep and fertile, closely covered
with grasses, interspersed with a proportion of gaudy
euchromias and lichnedias, with the purple and yellow
pedicularia, the tradescantia, and many beautiful astragali.</p>

<p>At Thrall's settlement,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> sixty miles above Loutre lick,
the floerkea proserpinacoides<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> is found in great abundance
in open fields and by the road side, reclining its flexile
and delicate stem upon the species of bidens, polygonum,
&amp;c. common in such situations. It grows much larger
here than at Albany, the only locality where we have met
with it east of the Mississippi; and its leaves, instead of
being quinate, are usually composed of six leafits. In
neither place does it show any preference to marshy
grounds, as the newly-proposed name, <i>palustris</i>, would
seem to imply. Our course, inclining considerably towards
the Missouri, made it necessary to leave the elevated
region of the plains, and betake ourselves to the
forests, soon after passing the Grand Prairie. In these
forests the linden, the hop-horn beam, maple, beech, and
ash, attain an uncommon magnitude. The blue beech
(ostrya virginica) sometimes occurs, and is of a larger
growth than in New England.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span></p>

<p>Extensive and very accessible beds of coal have been
opened near Thrall's plantation. The inhabitants assert
that, in sinking wells, the trunks of large trees have been
met with at a great depth below the surface. We could,
however, discover no satisfactory {102} confirmation of
this statement. The soil appeared to us to exhibit no
evidence of having been disturbed at any period since the
deposition of the coal beds and the accompanying sandstones.</p>

<p>On the 8th of June we arrived at Franklin. Here we
delayed several days, in the expectation of receiving from
Washington some further instructions, and the supply of
funds necessary for the prosecution of the duties of the
expedition. Having anxiously awaited one weekly arrival
of the mail, and being disappointed of the expected communications,
Major Long resolved to continue the journey,
and to proceed in the accomplishment of the services
assigned him, as far as the means then at his command
would allow. As the great part of our proposed route
to Council Bluff lay through the wilderness, we now
thought it necessary to procure two horses, in addition to
those we already had; one of them to be loaded with
provisions, and the other for the use of a man whom we
had engaged to accompany us.</p>

<p>We left Franklin on the 14th; and proceeding by a
rugged and circuitous road across a tract of hilly forests,
arrived at Charaton the same evening.</p>

<p>From Charaton to the mouth of Grand river,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> <i>the trace</i>,
as the paths are here called, passes through a tract of low
alluvial lands, partly covered with forests, but all extremely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
fertile. Here we were to take leave of the settlements,
and to pursue the remainder of our journey through the
wilderness; after dining in the cabin of a settler, we
crossed Grand river, and betook ourselves to the course
we thought proper to pursue, through a tangled and pathless
forest. This brought us, after a few hours, to the
border of an extensive plain. Our horses, somewhat
unaccustomed to travelling in woods, and particularly
the pack-horse, being young and untutored, gave us
much trouble.</p>

<p>After ascending into the prairie, as the night came on,
we were compelled to go a mile or two off {103} from our
course, in search of water and wood for our encampment;
at length finding a suitable place on the bank of a small
stream, called Doe creek, discharging into Grand river,
we kindled a fire, cooked, and ate our supper of bacon,
pilot-bread, and coffee; and as we had no tent, spread
our blankets under the shelter of a large tree, and laid
ourselves down to rest. The hooting of owls, together
with the howling of wolves, and the cries of other nocturnal
animals, as we were yet unaccustomed to them, occasionally
interrupted our slumbers. On the following morning,
however, we found ourselves well refreshed, and
were prepared to resume our journey at an early
hour.</p>

<p>The road known by the name of Field's trace ascends
from Charaton on the east side of Grand river about
sixty miles, thence running nearly north-west through the
immense plains of the Little Platte, the Nishnebottona,
and the Mosquito river, to Council Bluff. At the mouth
of Grand river we had learned that the eastern tributaries
of that stream were much swollen, and were therefore
difficult to cross; accordingly, we determined to ascend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
along the ridge between that river and the Little Platte,
until we should fall in with the trace.</p>

<p>We were detained several hours in searching for a place
where we might cross Doe creek. Though a very inconsiderable
stream, its steep muddy banks were now
almost filled, by the reflux occasioned by the freshet in
the Missouri. It was not without great difficulty we
at length effected a passage, at a point three miles distant
from our encampment; thence directing our course by
the compass, we travelled north, 45&deg; west, twenty-two
miles. In this distance we crossed three large creeks;
two of them running eastward into Grand river, the other
westward to the Wahconda.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>In the plains we met with nothing to obstruct travelling.
They had been perfectly denudated by {104} the burning
of the last season; and the annual growth of grasses and
weeds had as yet risen but about a foot from the ground.
Among the grasses are intermixed great numbers of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
legumina, with pinnated leaves; and these are so commonly
canescent as to give their peculiar silvery colour
to the whole plain. This effect is the more striking, when
a slight breeze agitates the leaves of the numerous species
of astragalus, psoralea, baptisia, and the beautiful amorpha
canescens, all of which have their inferior surfaces beset
with a shining silk-like down.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the 14th a storm of rain commenced,
which continued with little intermission for several days.
Having no tent, we were much exposed to the weather;
but at night we constructed a partial shelter, by stretching
our blankets over the spot on which we lay down to rest.</p>

<p>As we approached the sources of Grand river, the
country became more hilly. Horizontal limestone, like
that about St. Louis, appears in the sides of the deep
vallies.</p>

<p>In the scanty soils along these declivities the ferula
fœniculacea sometimes occurs, diffusing its powerful and
peculiar odour, perceptible after a shower at the distance
of several rods.</p>

<p>18th. The rain of the preceding day continued with
increased violence during the night. Our encampment
was completely inundated, and the wind so high as to
render our blanket-tent wholly useless. The small
portfolio, in which we had deposited such plants as we
wished to preserve, had been placed for a pillow in the
most sheltered part of the tent, and covered with a coat;
but these precautions, and all others we could adopt,
were unavailing; and the collection of plants we had then
made was lost.</p>

<p>Wishing to deviate as little as possible from the course
we had assumed, and which we knew it was necessary to
pursue, if we would follow the most {105} direct route to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
Council Bluff, we descended on the 19th, into a broad
and densely wooded valley on our left. After crossing a
part of this valley, through heavy forests of ash, sycamore,
and cotton-wood, our progress was checked by a river of
some magnitude, and so swollen and turbulent in consequence
of the late rains, that we thought it advisable not
to attempt the passage. We therefore relinquished our
course; and being a long time detained in painful and
fatiguing exertions to extricate ourselves from the forest,
regained towards evening the open plain, and encamped.</p>

<p>We had now ascended about eighty miles from the
mouth of Grand river. The country we had passed
is fertile, and presents such an intermixture of forests
and grassy plains, as is extremely pleasing to the eye.
Towards the north the hills became gradually more and
more elevated. The discontinuance of the horizontal
limestone, the disclosure in the deep vallies of the
more ancient varieties of sandstone, and the frequent
occurrence in the soil of small round masses of granite,
gneiss, and other primitive rocks, indicate an approach
towards the margin of the secondary basin. In the
deepest vallies, about the sources of Grand river, we
observe a very hard semi-crystalline sandstone, in rather
indistinct strata, and containing apparently few remains
either of plants or animals. It is, in almost every respect,
similar to that sandstone, which, in the valley of Lake
Champlain, rests along the skirts of the granitic mountains
of Ticonderoga, Crown Point, and Westport, and supports
there a small stratum of compact limestone. Containing
few fragments rounded by attrition, being almost
destitute of cement, and retaining much uniformity of
character in different localities, it has a manifest resemblance
to that most ancient of sandstones, which, in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
mountains of New England, is associated with the granular
limestone, and has sometimes been called {106}
granular quartz.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> Indeed we have no hesitation in
believing, that at some point near the sources of the De
Moyen and Grand river, the primitive rocks approach
near the surface. There is here a stratum of newer
sandstone, superimposed upon that above noticed, and
bearing marks of having been contemporaneous to some
formation of coal; but it is not of sufficient thickness,
in the parts we examined, to justify an opinion, that it
contains any valuable beds of that mineral. Leaving
the immediate neighbourhood of the river, there is an
ascent of several miles to the level of the great woodless
plain. The bottom, and part of the sides of the vallies,
are covered with trees; but in proportion to the elevation,
the surface becomes more unvaried and monotonous.
These vast plains, in which the eye finds no object to rest
upon, are at first seen with surprise and pleasure; but
their uniformity at length becomes tiresome.</p>

<p>For a few days the weather had been fine, with cool
breezes, and broken flying clouds. The shadows of
these coursing rapidly over the plain, seemed to put the
whole in motion; and we appeared to ourselves as if
riding on the unquiet billows of the ocean. The surface
is uniformly of the description, not inaptly called <i>rolling</i>,
and will certainly bear a comparison to the waves of an
agitated sea. The distant shores and promontories of
woodland, with here and there an insular grove of trees,
rendered the illusion more complete.</p>

<p>The great extent of country contemplated at a single
view, and the unvaried sameness of the surface, made our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
prospect seem tedious. We pursued our course during
the greater part of the day along the same wide plain, and
at evening the woody point in which we had encamped
on the preceding night was yet discernible.</p>

<p>{107} Nothing is more difficult than to estimate, by the
eye, the distance of objects seen in these plains. A small
animal, as a wolf or a turkey, sometimes appears of the
magnitude of a horse, on account of an erroneous
impression of distance. Three elk, which were the first
we had seen, crossed our path at some distance before us.
The effect of the <i>mirage</i>, together with our indefinite
idea of the distance, magnified these animals to a most
prodigious size. For a moment we thought we saw the
mastodon of America, moving in those vast plains, which
seem to have been created for his dwelling place. An
animal seen for the first time, or any object with
which the eye is unacquainted, usually appears much
enlarged, and inaccurate ideas are formed of the magnitude
and distance of all the surrounding objects; but
if some well-known animal, as a deer or a wolf, comes
into the field of vision so near as to be recognized, the
illusions vanish, and all things return to their proper
dimensions.</p>

<p>Soon after we had left our encampment, on one of the
bright sunny mornings which occurred, when we were in
the country near the sources of Grand river, we discovered,
as we thought, several large animals feeding in the prairie,
at the distance of half a mile. These, we believed,
could be no other than bisons; and after a consultation
respecting the best method of surprising them, two of
our party dismounted; and creeping with great care and
caution, about one-fourth of a mile through the high
grass, arrived near the spot, and discovered an old turkey,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
with her brood of half-grown young, the only animals now
to be seen.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 20th of May, we encamped in a
low, muddy bottom, overgrown with nettles and phacelias;
but the only place we could find combining the three
requisites—grass for our horses, and wood and water
for ourselves. Here we were so tormented by the mosquitoes,
harassed and goaded by the wood-ticks, {108}
that we were glad to seek relief by mounting our horses,
at the earliest appearance of light on the following morning.
The dew had been so heavy, that it was falling in
drops from the grass and weeds where we had lain, and
our blankets were dripping as if they had been exposed
to a shower. We proceeded on our course about thirty
miles, and encamped early in the afternoon. Having
ascended Grand river nearly to the point, where we believed
Field's trace must cross it, we directed our course
more to the west, and had already crossed several streams
running to the south, supposed to be the upper branches
of the Little Platte.</p>

<p>The utmost uniformity prevails in the appearance of
the country about the sources of the Little Platte, Nishnebottona,
and other northern tributaries of the Missouri.
Near one of these small rivers we discovered the trace of
an Indian war party, which appeared to have passed very
recently towards the Missouri. After our arrival at
Council Bluff, we had farther information of these Indians,
who were a war party of Sauks and Foxes from the Mississippi,
and had committed many depredations upon the
Missouri Indians, and some upon the whites. We were
considered very fortunate in not having fallen in with them,
as it was believed, they would not have hesitated to rob,
and perhaps destroy, any party of whites as weak as ours.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

<p>Remains of bisons, as bones, horns, hoofs, and the
like, are often seen in these plains; and in one instance,
in a low swamp surrounded by forests, we discovered the
recent track of a bull; but all the herds of these animals
have deserted the country on this side of Council Bluff.
The bones of elk and deer are very numerous, particularly
about certain places, which, from the great number of
tent poles, scaffolds, &amp;c. appear to be old Indian hunting
camps; and the living animals are still to be found here in
plenty. As we rode along these boundless meadows,
{109} every object within several miles became visible;
the smallest shrub rising a few inches above the surface
of the green expanse, could be seen at a mile distant.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>
Some large agarics, and a gigantic lycoperdon, peculiar
to these regions, are the most conspicuous objects by
which the uniformity of the plains is varied; and these
may be seen sometimes at the distance of two or three
miles.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 24th, we arrived on the bank of
a beautiful river, at a grove of ash and cotton-wood trees.
We had scarce dismounted from our horses, when a
violent thunder-shower commenced; the rain fell in
such torrents as to extinguish our fire, and the wind blew
so violently that our blanket-tent could afford us no
protection. Many large trees were blown down in the
point of woods where we lay, and one fell a few yards
from our camp. As the night was extremely dark, we
thought the danger of moving at least equal to that of
remaining where we were; and spent part of the night in
the greatest anxiety, listening to the roar of the storm,
and the crashing of the timber. As our horses were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
dispersed about the wood, we had scarce a hope they
could all escape uninjured.</p>

<p>On the day following, after we had rode about eighteen
or twenty miles, we observed the surface of the country
to become suddenly hilly; and soon after were surprised
by an unexpected view of the wide valley, the green
meadows, and the yellow stream of the Missouri. A
little after noon we encamped in a meadow on the river
bottom, and by ascending one of the neighbouring bluffs;
sufficiently elevated to overlook a large extent of the surrounding
country, we were enabled to discover that we
had arrived at the Missouri, at a point about {110} six
miles below the confluence of the great river Platte.</p>

<p>On the precipitous and almost naked argillaceous hills,
which here bound the Missouri valley, we found the
oxytropis lambertii, and the great flowering pentstemon;
two plants of singular beauty. Here, also, we saw, for
the first time, the leafless prenanthes, the yellow euchromia,
and many other interesting plants. It would seem
that several species of plants are distributed along the
course of the Missouri, but do not extend far on either
side. Probably the seeds of these have been brought down
from their original localities, near the sources of the river.
That the distribution of plants is sometimes effected in
this way, there can be no doubt, as in the instance of the
portulacca, with pilose leaves,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> and other natives of the
high and sandy plains of the Arkansa, which are sometimes
found transplanted into the deep forests and fertile soils
of the hilly region; but the agency of rivers in this respect
appears much less important, than without particular
examination, we might be inclined to imagine. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
ascending the Missouri, the Arkansa, or any great river,
every remove of forty or fifty miles brings the traveller
to the locality of some plants, not to be seen below.
This is perhaps less the case with rivers running from east
to west, or from west to east, than with those whose
course in a different direction, traverses several parallels
of latitude.</p>

<p>On the 27th, we swam across Mosquito Creek;<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> and
after a ride of near thirty miles along the Missouri bottoms,
encamped near the mouth of the Boyer,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> about six
miles from the wintering place of the party. Early on
the following morning we left our encampment, and were
soon after cheered by the report of guns discharging at
the Cantonment. The sight of the trading establishment,
called Fort Lisa, gave us {111} more pleasure than can
easily be imagined, except by those who have made journeys
similar to ours, and have felt the deprivation of all
those enjoyments which belongs to the habitations of men.
At ten a. m. we arrived at the Boyer, which Major Long
immediately crossed on a small raft, leaving Captain
Bell and Dr. James, with the horses and baggage, to wait
until some soldiers could be sent out to assist in crossing.
These arrived in a few hours; and before three o'clock
we had crossed the Boyer and the Missouri, and found
ourselves surrounded by our friends at Engineer Cantonment.</p>

<p>In the early part of June, 1820, arrangements were
completed for the departure of the Exploring Expedition
from their winter cantonment near Council Bluff. By
an order of the Honourable Secretary of War, dated 28th
February, Major Long had been instructed to explore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
the country from the Missouri westward to the Rocky
Mountains; and thence, proceeding southward along the
base of these mountains to the Arkansa, to despatch a
division of his party down that river. The following
orders were issued by Major Long, briefly sketching the
proposed route, and assigning appropriate duties to each
individual of the party.</p>

<div>

<span class="inline w50">"<i>Orders</i>.</span>
<span class="inline center"><i>June 1st, 1820.</i></span>
</div>

<p>"Agreeably to the instructions of the Honourable
Secretary of War, the further progress of the Exploring
Expedition up the Missouri is arrested during the present
season. By the same authority, an excursion, by land,
to the source of the river Platte, and thence by way of the
Arkansa and Red rivers to the Mississippi, is ordered.
The expedition will accordingly proceed on this duty as
soon as practicable, and be governed by the order of the
31st March, 1819, issued at the United States' arsenal,
near Pittsburgh, so far as it may be applicable. The
duties therein assigned to Major Biddle will be performed
{112} by Captain J. R. Bell, attached to the expedition
by order of the war department, with the exception of
those parts which relate to the manners, customs, and
traditions of the various savage tribes which we may pass.
The duties thus excepted will be performed by Mr. Say.
The duties assigned to Dr. Baldwin and Mr. Jessup, by
the order alluded to, will be performed by Dr. E. James,
employed for these purposes, by the sanction of the
secretary of war. In these duties are excepted those
parts which relate to comparative anatomy, and the
diseases, remedies, &amp;c. known amongst the Indians;
which will also be performed by Mr. Say.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p>"Lieutenant Graham will take charge of the United
States' steam-boat, Western Engineer, and proceed down
the Missouri to the Mississippi, with the remaining part
of the crew originally attached to the boat, on the performance
of duties assigned him by special order.</p>

<p>"The detachment from the rifle regiment, attached to
the expedition, by order from the commanding officer
of the 9th military department, will accompany the
expedition in their route from this place to Belle Point,
on the Arkansa, under the immediate command of Lieutenant
Swift, who will inspect daily their arms and accoutrements,
and report their condition to the commanding
officer. He will receive such instructions from the commanding
officer as occasion may require, in relation to the
discharge of his duties.</p>

<p>"Guides, interpreters, hunters, and others attached
to the expedition, will perform such duties as may be
assigned, from time to time, by the commanding
officer.</p>

<p>"The duties of the expedition being arduous, and the
objects in view difficult of attainment, the hardships and
exposures to be encountered requiring zealous and
obstinate perseverance, it is confidently expected, that
all embarked in the enterprize will {113} contribute every
aid in their power, tending to a successful and speedy
termination of the contemplated tour.</p>

<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">S. H. Long</span>, <i>Maj. Engrs.</i><br />
<i>Commanding Exploring Expedition.</i>"</p>

<p>The party, as now arranged, consisted of the following
persons:</p>

<p>S. H. Long, Major, U. S. Topographical Engineers,
commanding the expedition.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

<p>J. R. Bell, Captain Lt. Artillery, to act as Journalist.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>W. H. Swift, assistant Topographer, commanding
guard.</p>

<p>Thos. Say, Zoologist, &amp;c.</p>

<p>E. James, Botanist, Geologist, and Surgeon.</p>

<p>T. R. Peale, assistant Naturalist.</p>

<p>Saml. Seymour, Landscape Painter.</p>

<p>Stephen Julien, Interpreter, French and Indian.</p>

<p>H. Dougherty, Hunter.</p>

<p>D. Adams, Spanish Interpreter.</p>

<p>Z. Wilson, Baggage Master.</p>

<p>Oakley and Duncan, Engagees.</p>

<p>Corporal Parish, and six privates of the U. S. army.</p>

<p>To these we expected an addition, on our arrival at
the Pawnee villages, of two Frenchmen, to serve as
guides and interpreters, one of them having already
been engaged.</p>

<p>Twenty-eight horses and mules had been provided;
one for each individual of the party, and eight for carrying
packs. Of these, six were the property of the United
States, being furnished by the commanding officer at
Camp Missouri; the remaining sixteen were supplied by
Major Long, and others of the party. {114} Our saddles
and other articles of equipage, were of the rudest kind,
being, with a few exceptions, such as we had purchased
from the Indians, or constructed ourselves.</p>

<p>Our outfit comprised the following articles of provisions,
Indian goods, &amp;c. viz. 150lb. of pork, 500lb. of biscuit,
3 bushels of parched corn meal, 5 gallons of whiskey,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
25lb. of coffee, 30lb. of sugar, and a small quantity of
salt, 5lb. of vermilion, 2lb. of beads, 2 gross of knives, 1
gross of combs, 1 dozen of fire steels, 300 flints, 1 dozen
of gun worms, 2 gross of hawk's bells, 2 dozen of mockasin
awls, 1 dozen of scissors, 6 dozen of looking glasses, 30lb.
of tobacco, and a few trinkets, 2 axes, several hatchets,
forage-bags, canteens, bullet-pouches, powder-horns, tin
cannisters, skin canoes, packing-skins, pack cords, and
some small packing-boxes for insects, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The gentlemen of the party were supplied with such
instruments as were deemed indispensably requisite in
their several pursuits. The instruments for topographical
purposes were, three travelling, and several pocket compasses;
one sextant, with radius of five inches; one snuffbox
sextant; one portable horizon with glass frame and
mercurial trough; one and a half pounds of mercury, in
a case of box-wood; two small thermometers; several
blank books, portfolios, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The hunters, interpreters, and attendants, were furnished
with rifles or muskets; the soldiers were armed
exclusively with rifles, and suitably equipped. Our
stock of ammunition amounted in all to about 30
pounds of powder, 20 pounds of balls, and 40 pounds of
lead, with a plentiful supply of flints, and some small
shot.</p>

<p>Several of the Indians about Council Bluff, to whom
our proposed route had been explained, and who had
witnessed our preparations, affected to laugh at our
temerity, in attempting what they said we should never
be able to accomplish. They represented some {115} part
of the country, through which we intended to travel, as
so entirely destitute of water and grass, that neither ourselves
nor our horses could be subsisted while passing it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
Baron Vasquez,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> who accompanied Captain Pike, in his
expedition to the sources of the Arkansa, assured us there
was no probability we could avoid the attacks of hostile
Indians, who infested every part of the country. The
assault which had been recently made by a party of the
Sauks and Foxes, upon a trading boat belonging to Messrs.
Pratte<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> and Vasquez, on the Missouri, above Council
Bluff, in which one man was killed, and several wounded,
had at this time spread considerable terror among those
in any degree exposed to the hostilities of the Indians.</p>

<p>With these prospects, and with the very inadequate
outfit above described, which was the utmost our united
means enabled us to furnish, we departed from Engineer
Cantonment, at 11 o'clock, on the 6th of June.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>The path leading to the Pawnee villages runs in a
direction a little south of west from the cantonment, and
lies across a tract of high and barren prairie for the first
ten miles. At this distance it crosses the Papillon, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
Butterfly creek, a small stream discharging into the
Missouri three miles above the confluence of the Platte.
Lieutenant Graham and Mr. J. Dougherty accompanied
us about five miles on our way; we were also met by
Lieutenant Talcott from Camp Missouri, who crossed
the bluffs on foot, to take leave of us. Much delay was
occasioned, as we passed along, by the derangement of
the packs, the obstinacy of the mules, and the want of
dexterity and experience in our engagees; we however
arrived early in the afternoon at the Papillon, where
we encamped.</p>

<p>The Papillon, although it traverses a considerable
extent of country, was at this time but a trifling stream.
Its channel is narrow, the banks steep, and {116} like
many other streams which have their whole course in these
arid plains, it is nearly destitute of water, except in rainy
seasons.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>During the night some rain fell, but as we were furnished
with three tents, sufficiently large to shelter all our
party, we experienced little inconvenience from the
storm. Our baggage was also effectually protected, being
laid in heaps, and covered with bear-skins; which were
also spread over it when placed upon the pack-horses,
during our march by day.</p>

<p>We had each two small blankets, which were carried
upon our horses, one being placed under the saddle, and
the other upon it. These, with the addition, in some
instances, of a great coat, or a blanket-capot, and a valise
or a pair of holsters, to supply the place of a pillow, were
our only articles of bedding.</p>

<p>On morning of the 7th, a new disposition was made,
in relation to the pack-horses, a man being appointed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
attend particularly to each. We breakfasted, and recommenced
our journey at an early hour, and moving
forward at an easy pace, arrived about ten o'clock at the
Elk-horn,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> a considerable river, tributary to the Platte.
On the preceding evening, we had been joined at our
camp by a party of three or four Frenchmen, on their
way to a hunting camp of the Omawhaws to trade. We
purchased of them two small brass kettles, to complete
our supply of camp furniture. One of these men had
been of Pratte and Vasquez's party, at the time of the late
attack, and had received, in that affair, a wound in the
back from a rifle ball, which was yet unhealed. In the
morning they accompanied us to the Elk-horn, where
the wounded Frenchman was one of the first to strip and
plunge into the river. Surprising accounts are given of
the hardihood, and patience under suffering, manifested
by the Indians; but we have rarely seen one of them {117}
exhibit a more striking instance of insensibility to pain,
than this Frenchman.</p>

<p>The Elk-horn, called Wa-ta-tung-ya by the Otoes, is,
where we crossed it, about thirty yards wide, and during
a great part of the year, too deep and rapid to admit of
being forded. At this time our horses were barely able
to keep their feet, in crossing the deepest part of the
channel. Our heavy baggage was ferried across in a
portable canoe, consisting of a single bison hide, which
we carried constantly with us. Its construction is extremely
simple; the margin of the hide being pierced
with several small holes, admits a cord, by which it is
drawn into the form of shallow basin. This is placed
upon the water, and is kept sufficiently distended by the
baggage which it receives; it is then towed or pushed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
across. A canoe of this kind will carry from four to
five hundred pounds. The squaws, who are exceedingly
expert in this sort of navigation, transport not only their
baggage, but their children, and sometimes adults,
across large rivers, in these canoes, and with the most
perfect safety. They place their children on the baggage,
and convey the whole across the stream, by swimming
themselves, and urging their charge before them to the
opposite shore. It is rare that any unpleasant accident
occurs in this primitive mode of ferrying.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> The Elk-horn
enters the Platte about fifty miles above the confluence of
that river and the Missouri. Its whole course is through a
country nearly destitute of timber. The low plains {118}
which extend along its bank have a fertile soil; but the
want of timber opposes a serious obstacle to their settlement.</p>

<p>The soil and climate here are so entirely similar to
those of the country about Grand river and the Little
Platte, already described, that no change in the vegetable
productions could be expected. A species of onion, with
a root about as large as an ounce ball, and bearing a conspicuous
umbel of purple flowers, is very abundant
about the streams, and furnished a valuable addition to
our bill of fare.</p>

<p>Soon after crossing the Elk-horn we entered the valley
of the Platte, which presented the view of an unvaried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
plain, from three to eight miles in width, and extending
more than one hundred miles along that river, being a
vast expanse of prairie, or natural meadow, without a
hill or other inequality of surface, and with scarce a tree
or a shrub to be seen upon it. The woodlands, occupying
the islands in the Platte, bound it on one side; the river-hills,
low and gently sloped, terminate it on the other.</p>

<p>At about three o'clock, <small>P. M.</small>, a party of ten Indians
were seen crossing the plain, towards the Platte, at a great
distance before us. Soon after we arrived at a small
creek, where was some scattered timber: here we determined
to halt for the night, being informed by our guide
that we would meet with no wood for twenty miles beyond.</p>

<p>As Indians had been seen in the afternoon, and we
were aware of their being still in our neighbourhood, it
was thought proper to stake the horses as near as possible
to the camp, and to station two sentinels, who were to be
relieved during the night.</p>

<p>In our encampment we observed the following order.
The three tents were pitched in a right line, all fronting
in the same direction. In advance of these, at the distance
of four feet, our baggage was arranged in six heaps,
one at the right, and one at the left of the entrance to
each tent, and protected from {119} the weather by bear-skins
thrown over them. This disposition was made,
not only for the convenience of the party, but that our
baggage, in case of an attack of the Indians, might serve
as a kind of breast-work, behind which we might be, in
some measure, sheltered from danger. At any rate,
having our baggage thus arranged, we should know where
to find it, and where to rally, in any emergency by day
or night.</p>

<p>On the ensuing morning, (8th,) we continued our journey
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
along the north side of the valley of the Platte, at the
distance of four or five miles from the river, the direction
of our course south, 85&deg; west, which we followed near
twenty miles.</p>

<p>In all our marches we observed the following order.
Capt. Bell, mounted on a horse whose gait was regular
and uniform, and well calculated for the estimation of
distances, preceded the party, attended by our guide.—The
soldiers and attendants, formed into two squads,
for the better management of the pack-horses, followed
in single file.—The scientific gentlemen occupied any
part of the line that best suited their convenience.—Major
Long followed in the rear, for the purpose of
superintending the readjustment of deranged packs, and
urging any disposed to linger, to the observance of a
close order of march, a duty attended with no inconsiderable
trouble and perplexity. Though our route lay
at the distance of several miles from the Platte, we could
distinctly see the narrow and interrupted line of timber
which grows along its course, and occasionally we had a
transient view of the river itself, spreading like an expansive
lake, and embosoming innumerable islands. About
eighteen miles from our encampment, our course led us
into the valley of a small river, called La petite Coquille
or Muscleshell Creek,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> which we ascended six miles, not
deviating from the course we had taken. In the middle
of the day we encountered a violent thunder-storm
without dismounting {120} from our horses. The plain
about us, for a great distance, was destitute of timber, and
so level that our party formed the most prominent object
in an extent of several miles. It is not surprising that,
in this situation, we were a little startled at seeing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
lightning strike upon the ground at the distance of two
hundred yards from us. We could not have been deceived,
in relation to this appearance, as we distinctly saw the
water and mud thrown several feet into the air by the shock.
The storm was so violent that, notwithstanding all our
care, we could not prevent our baggage from being wet.
We crossed the Coquille six miles above the place where
it enters the valley of the Platte. This we effected with
some difficulty, the banks being steep and muddy, and
immediately afterwards encamped to dry our baggage.</p>

<p>The Coquille is about eight yards across; its bed muddy
and the current moderate. Its course is circuitous,
traversing some inconsiderable tracts of fertile and well
wooded bottom land: in one of these our camp was
placed. The night was warm and the mosquitoes swarming
in inconceivable multitudes.</p>

<p>Our baggage had been wet on the preceding day, and
again by a heavy shower in the night: as the morning
was cloudy, we remained in camp for some time, and
attempted to dry our clothes and blankets by a large fire.
After breakfasting we again got upon our horses, and
travelling nearly south-west, arrived in the afternoon at
the valley of the Wolf river, or Loup fork of the Platte.
This river is called by the Indians the Little Missouri,
on account of its resemblance, in the velocity of its current,
the turbidness of its waters, and other respects, to that
river.</p>

<p>Its sources are in the country of the Poncaras, opposite
those of the Quicurre.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> Like the Platte, its {121} immediate
valley is a broad and woodless plain, almost without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
any perceptible unevenness of surface, and bounded on
each side by parallel ranges of low and barren hills.</p>

<p>During our ride, as we were approaching the Loup fork,
we met two Pawnee Indians, handsomely mounted, and,
as they informed us, on their way to dance the calumet
dance with the Omawhaws. We gave them a small quantity
of tobacco, and they departed, appearing highly
pleased. In the fertile grounds, along the valley of the
Loup fork, we observed several plants which we had not
before seen: among these was one belonging to the family
of the malvace&aelig;, with a large tuberous root which is soft
and edible, being by no means ungrateful to the taste.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> We
observed also the downy spike of the rabbit's-foot plantain
(plantago lagopus, Ph.) intermixed with the short grasses
of the prairie. The long-flowered puccoon, (batschia longiflora,
N.) a larger and more beautiful plant than the B.
canescens is here frequent. As we proceed westward,
some changes are observed in the character of the soil and
the aspect of vegetation. The larkspurs and lichnedias,
(species of phlox and delphinium, so common and beautiful
in all the country between St. Louis and Council Bluff,)
are succeeded by several species of milk vetch,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> some
vicias, and the superb sweet pea (lathyrus polymorphus).
Every step of our progress to the west brought us upon a
less fertile soil. We had as yet seen no game except a few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
antelopes, too wild and watchful to be taken without much
trouble. In the low prairies we saw several curlews and
marbled godwits, with their young; Bartram's sandpiper
was also very frequent.</p>

<p>{122} A little before sunset we crossed Grape Creek,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>
a small and rapid stream of clear water, and soon after
arrived at the Loup fork, where we encamped. The banks
of this river are of a fine white sand, and are elevated no
more than about eight feet above the surface of the stream,
at a time of low water. It does not however appear that
the low plains, contiguous to the Loup fork, are at any
season inundated, the channel being sufficiently wide, and
the current rapid enough to discharge all the water, which
may at any time be brought down from above.</p>

<p>In the evening, and on the following morning, observations
were taken to ascertain the magnetic variation, which
was found to be 13&frac12;&deg; east.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 10th, we crossed Beaver Creek,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>
six miles south-west of our encampment. Here we were
compelled to carry across our baggage by hand, the creek
being too deep and muddy to admit risking it on the pack-horses.</p>

<p>In fording this difficult stream, we had the misfortune
to lose an important part of the lock of an air-gun, and as
there were no means of replacing the lost article, it was
determined to send back the gun from the Pawnee villages
by one of the traders, who was soon to return to the Missouri.</p>

<p>While we were encamped at this spot, being detained by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
a heavy shower, three Frenchmen and two Indians, arrived
at the ford, on their way to the Pawnee villages. They
told us they had eaten nothing since they left the Missouri.
One of the Frenchmen brought a letter from Lieutenant
Graham, and a box containing a quantity of vaccine
virus, transmitted to the exploring party, for the purpose
of introducing vaccination among the Indians. The box
alluded to had been sent to the war department, by Mr.
Sylvanus Fancher,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> a gentleman in Connecticut, and
forwarded to the commanding officer of the expedition. It
contained a considerable {123} quantity of virus, carefully
enclosed in a variety of packing apparatus, together with
instructions relative to the disposition and application of it.
But as it was not transmitted till after the departure of the
expedition from Pittsburgh, it had been forwarded by mail
to St. Louis, whence it was conveyed up the Missouri, by
a gentleman of the military expedition, under Colonel
Atkinson. Unfortunately, the keel-boat, on board of
which it had been deposited, was wrecked in ascending
the river, and the box and its contents, although
saved from the wreck, was thoroughly drenched, and the
virus completely ruined. It was received three or four
weeks after the catastrophe just mentioned, and was still
drenched with water.</p>

<p>The Frenchmen had, on their way, caught a horse belonging
to Mr. J. Dougherty, and intended for the use of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
his brother, who was of our party. He had escaped several
weeks previous, from Engineer Cantonment, and
since that time had been wandering in the prairies. This
formed a valuable addition to our stock of horses, as a
number of them were already unfit for service, on account
of sore backs.</p>

<p>The Frenchmen and Indians were supplied with provisions
from our packs, and proceeded immediately on
their way, intending to reach the Pawnee villages the same
evening.</p>

<p>At a late hour in the afternoon we resumed our journey,
and at the distance of four miles from Beaver Creek,
crossed the Creek of Souls, a small and muddy stream, in
which two of the pack-horses fell, again wetting our baggage.</p>

<p>At sunset we arrived at a small creek, eleven miles distant
from the village of the Grand Pawnees, where we
encamped.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p>On the following morning, having arranged the party
according to rank, and given the necessary instructions
for the preservation of order, we proceeded forward, and
in a short time came in sight of {124} the first of the Pawnee
villages. The trace on which we had travelled since we
left the Missouri, had the appearance of being more and
more frequented as we approached the Pawnee towns;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
and here, instead of a single footway, it consisted of more
than twenty parallel paths, of similar size and appearance.
At a few miles distance from the village, we met a party
of eight or ten squaws with hoes and other instruments of
agriculture, on their way to the corn plantations. They
were accompanied by one young Indian, but in what capacity,
whether as assistant, protector, or task-master,
we were not informed. After a ride of about three hours,
we arrived before the village, and despatched a messenger
to inform the chief of our approach.</p>

<p>Answer was returned that he was engaged with his chiefs
and warriors at a medicine feast, and could not, therefore,
come out to meet us. We were soon surrounded by a
crowd of women and children, who gazed at us with some
expressions of astonishment; but as no one appeared to
welcome us to the village, arrangements were made for
sending on the horses and baggage to a suitable place for
encampment, while Major Long, with several gentlemen,
who wished to accompany him, entered the village.</p>

<p>The party which accompanied Major Long, after groping
about some time, and traversing a considerable part
of the village, arrived at the lodge of the principal chief.
Here we were again informed that Tarrarecawaho, with all
the principal men of the village, were engaged at a medicine
feast.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his absence, some mats were spread
for us upon the ground, in the back part of the lodge.
Upon these we sat down, and after waiting some time, were
presented with a large wooden dish of hominy, or boiled
maize. In this was a single spoon of the horn of a bison,
large enough to hold half a pint, which, being used alternately
by each of the party, soon emptied the dish of its
contents.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span></p>

<p>{125} The interior of this capacious dwelling was dimly lighted
from a hole at the top, through which the sun's
rays, in a defined column, fell aslant upon the earthen
floor. Immediately under this hole, which is both window
and chimney, is a small depression in the centre of the
floor, where the fire is made; but the upper parts of the
lodge are constantly filled with smoke, adding much to the
air of gloominess and obscurity which prevailed within.
The furniture of Long Hair's lodge consisted of mats,
ingeniously woven of grass or rushes, bison robes, wooden
dishes, and one or two small brass kettles. In the part
of the lodge immediately opposite the entrance, we observed
a rude niche in the wall, which was occupied by a
bison skull. It appeared to have been exposed to the
weather, until the flesh and periosteum had decayed, and
the bones had become white.</p>

<p>In this lodge we saw a number of squaws of different
ages, but all, as we supposed, the wives of Long Hair.
This chief, who is somewhat of a Turk in his domestic
establishment, has eleven wives, nine of whom are quiet
occupants of the same lodge. He has but ten children.</p>

<p>Our visit to this village seemed to excite no great degree
of attention. Among the crowd, who surrounded us before
we entered the village, we observed several young squaws
rather gaily dressed, being wrapped in clean and new
blankets, and having their heads ornamented with wreaths
of gnaphalium, and the silvery leaves of the prosalea canescens.
On the tops of the lodges we also saw some display
of finery, which we supposed to have been made on
account of our visit. Flags were hoisted, shields, and bows,
and quivers, were suspended in conspicuous places, scalps
were hung out; in short, the people appeared to have exposed
whatever they possessed, in the exhibition of which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
they could find any gratification of their vanity. Aside
from these, we received no distinguished marks of attention
from the Grand Pawnees.</p>

<p>{126} After spending an hour or two at their village, we
retired to our camp about a mile distant. Here we were
shortly afterwards visited by Long Hair, the Malicious
chief,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> and several others. They had with them a young
Spaniard, who interpreted Pawnee and French, by whose
means we were able to communicate freely with them.
They offered some apology, for not receiving us at their
village, saying, they could not have left their medicine
feast, if the village had been on fire. We caused our intended
route to be explained to them, with the objects we
had in view, in undertaking so long a journey. To this
they answered, that our undertaking was attended with
great difficulty and danger; that the country about the
head of the Platte was filled with bands of powerful and
ferocious Indians, who would lose no opportunity to attack
and injure us; that in some parts of our route, we must
suffer from want of water, in others there was no game. "In
short," said the Grand chief, "you must have long hearts,
to undertake such a journey with so weak a force; hearts
that would reach from the earth to the heavens." These
representations would, it is probable, have had some effect
upon our spirits, had we not supposed they were made entirely
for that purpose. The Pawnees undoubtedly hoped
to alarm our fears to such a degree, that we should be
induced to relinquish our proposed journey; their design
being to deter us from passing through their hunting
grounds, and perhaps hoping by these means to possess
themselves of a larger share of the articles we had provided
for Indian presents.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

<p>Finding our determination was not to be shaken, they
advised us to ascend the Loup fork, instead of taking the
route by the Platte, which we had mentioned. This advice,
and the statement by which it was accompanied, that
there were no bisons on the Platte, we suspected of originating
from the same motive which had induced them to
make the representation {127} above mentioned; it was
not, therefore, allowed in any manner to influence our
determination.</p>

<p>After collecting from them what information we could
obtain, relative to the country to the west, we endeavoured
to dismiss them with some presents. They were not, however,
easily to be satisfied—they importuned us for tobacco,
and other articles, which the limited nature of our
supplies would not allow us to give, as we expected soon to
meet with Indians, whose good will it would be more important
for us to purchase.</p>

<p>Our camp was something more than a mile from the
village. The intervening space, as well as the plain for a
great extent on all sides, was covered with great numbers
of horses, intermixed with men, women, and children.
The men having no serious business, pass much of their
time in the open air, either on horseback, or engaged at
some game of hazard.</p>

<p>The Pawnees are expert horsemen, and delight in the
exhibition of feats of skill and adroitness. Many of their
horses are branded, but this is the case with such only as
are taken in their predatory excursions against the Spaniards
of New Mexico, or the south-western Indians; the
branded horses all come originally from the Spaniards.
It does not appear that the Indians have any method of
affixing distinctive marks to their animals. Each Indian
has usually but a very limited number of horses, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
are as well known, and as universally acknowledged to be
his, as the children or other members of his family. Some
of the finest horses which we observed, were ornamented
with gaudy trappings, and furniture of Spanish manufacture.</p>

<p>We spent some time in attempting to explain to the
chiefs the nature and effects of the vaccine disease, and in
endeavouring to persuade them to influence some of their
people to submit to inoculation; {128} but in this we were
unsuccessful. It is now several years since the ravages
of the small pox have been experienced among them, and
it is probable they feel an undue degree of security against
its future visitations. We were, however, by no means
confident that they comprehended what we said on the
subject of vaccination; if they did, it is not probable their
confidence in us was sufficient to induce them to receive it
as truth. All we were able to effect, was to persuade the
young Spanish interpreter to allow us to make use of his
arm, to show the Indians that the proposed operation was
by no means a formidable one. With the same intention,
the operation was performed upon Major Long's arm, and
that of Mr. H. Dougherty.</p>

<p>We were not very solicitous to make the experiment
among them, our virus, as before remarked, being unfit
for use. We were accordingly afraid of impairing their
confidence in the remedy.</p>

<p>In the plain about the village, we noticed several little
groups of squaws, busily engaged in dressing the skins of
the bison for robes. When the processes of tanning and
dressing are completed, and the inner surface of the skin
dry, figures are traced upon it with vermilion, and other
showy colours.</p>

<p>These are designed as ornaments, but are sometimes a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
record of important facts. The story of a battle is often
depicted in this way, and the robe of a warrior is frequently
decorated with the narration, in pictures, of some of his
exploits.</p>

<p>During the afternoon our camp was somewhat thronged
by the Indians, offering to trade horses, and squaws proposing
barters, but at night they withdrew towards their
village, and all remained quiet.</p>

<p>As the day began to dawn on the following morning,
numerous parties of squaws, accompanied by their dogs,
were seen on their way from the village to the corn patches,
scattered at the distance of several miles.</p>

<p>{129} At sunrise we mounted our horses, and arranging
ourselves as on the preceding day, and carrying a white
silk flag with a painted design, emblematic of peaceable
intentions in the front, and the United States' flag in the
centre of our party, we moved forward towards the second
village, distant about three miles from our camp.</p>

<p>The bands which inhabit this village, are called Republican
Pawnees. This name, it is said, has been applied
to this band, in consequence of their having seceded from
the parent stock or Grand Pawnees, some years since, and
established themselves under a separate government.</p>

<p>They resided formerly on the Republican fork of the
Konzas river, to which they have given their name;
whence they removed a few years since to their present
situation, that they might enjoy the protection of their more
powerful allies, the Grand Pawnees. Their village is distant
four miles from that of the Grand Pawnees, and like
it on the immediate bank of the river. Fool Robe, their
chief, received us with a little more attention than we had
met on the preceding day, shaking us each by the
hand. He afterwards conducted us to his lodge, within
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
the village, but excused himself from feasting us, saying,
his squaws were all absent at the corn fields.</p>

<p>It was a war party from this band which had plundered
the detachment from the steam-boat on the preceding
summer near the Konza village. For this outrage they
had been compelled, by the prompt and vigorous interference
of Major O'Fallon, the Indian agent, to make
ample restitution. Whether it was that Fool Robe and
his warriors were yet a little sore on account of this affair,
or for some other reason, it was evident we were not welcome
visitants. We had hitherto entertained exalted
ideas of the hospitality of the Pawnees in their manner of
receiving strangers, and were consequently a little {130}
disappointed at the reception we had met. We stayed
but a short time with Fool Robe. Having briefly described
to him the outline of our intended journey, and listened to
his remarks and advice respecting it, we remounted our
horses, and proceeded towards the Loup village.</p>

<p>On our way we were met by the Knife-chief, who, having
heard of our intention to visit him, came out on horseback,
and met us more than a mile from the village. He
gave us a very cordial and friendly reception, frequently
rubbing his breast in token of the satisfaction he felt at
seeing us. His frank and intelligent countenance, and
his impressive gestures, made him easily understood,
without the aid of an interpreter. As our cavalcade passed
by him, he appeared to examine, with some attention, the
physiognomy and appointments of the individuals composing
it; but when his rapid eye alighted upon Julien,
with whom he could use much freedom, he rode up to him,
and eagerly inquired, by means of signs, (v. Nos. 27. and
14.)<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> if we had brought with us any whiskey, which we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
were grieved to learn, by this intimation, that he was acquainted
with, and would indulge in; Julien replied in the
negative, by the exhibition of the proper sign, (No. 65.)
with which he did not betray any dissatisfaction, although
it was evident from his subsequent conversation that he
believed it to be false. On the way to the village he
pointed out a convenient place for us to dispose of our
horses and establish our camp. Here we dismounted,
leaving our horses in the care of the guard, and followed
the chief to his lodge. Soon after our arrival a large dish
was placed before us, according to the custom of the Indians,
filled with boiled sweet corn. While we were eating,
the Knife-chief, with the principal men of his nation, were
sitting silently behind us. Having finished our repast,
we gave the Indians an account of ourselves, the occasion
of our visit to {131} them, our intended journey to the
mountains at the head of the Platte, &amp;c. as in the other
villages. To all this the Knife-chief listened with great
attention. He expressed himself satisfied with the account
we had given of the objects of our enterprize, but feared
we should be ill treated by the savages we should meet.
"Your heart must be strong," said he, "to go upon so
hazardous a journey. May the Master of Life be your
protector." The same benediction had been given us by
the chiefs of the Republican and Grand Pawnees, probably
with nearly the same degree of ingenuousness and
sincerity. The Pawnees are at war with the Arrapahoes,
Kaskaias,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> and other erratic bands, who wander about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
the sources of the Platte and Arkansa. Their war parties
are often sent out in that direction, where they sometimes
meet a spirited reception from their enemies. It may be
on this account that the Pawnees connect the idea of imminent
danger to an excursion into those parts of the
country which we proposed to visit. It is, however, highly
probable their unwillingness to have us pass through their
hunting grounds was the most productive cause of all the
anxiety, and all the fears they expressed on our account.</p>

<p>The chief addressed us for some time with great apparent
earnestness, but his discourse, as it came to our comprehension
by the aid of an interpreter, whom we obtained
at this village, seemed directed solely to one object, the
exciting our compassion for his poverty.</p>

<p>"Father,—You see me here; I am very poor; my
young men are very poor; we hope our Great Father will
not forget the red skins, his children, they are poor;" with
a great deal more in the same strain. He, however, returned
frequently to the subject of our journey to the west.
"I will tell my young men," said he, (meaning the war
parties which should be sent out in that direction,) "when
{132} they meet you, to take you by the hand, and smoke
the peace pipe with you."</p>

<p>The Knife-chief, with his son Petalesharoo, celebrated
for his filial affection, his valour, and his humanity, visited
us at our camp in the afternoon, and we were proud to
entertain one whom we thought so worthy of our admiration.
We also received a visit from a <i>Medicine-man</i>, who,
having heard there were great medicine men belonging
to our party, requested to be shown some of the mysteries
of their profession. We accordingly displayed before him
a pair of bullet-forceps, a small case of surgeons' instruments,
and some similar articles, and began to explain to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
him the use of each. He attended for some time to our
discourse, but apparently without comprehending any
part of it, and at length turned abruptly away, with an air
of dissatisfaction and contempt.</p>

<p>The Canadian, who had been engaged before we left
the Missouri as a guide, now gave us to understand that
it was not his intention to accompany the expedition.
Having been informed of other persons in the village who
were qualified for this undertaking, Major Long made
application to several of these, who at first expressed a
willingness to accompany him, but soon afterwards recalled
their promises. Finding them disposed to trifle in
this manner, he at length assured them that, unless some
one was immediately procured to attend the expedition as
guide, their refusal, and the breach of engagement on the
part of Bijeau, should be made known to the agent, and
the whole corps of Canadian traders be deprived of the
privilege of residing, or trading among the Pawnees. This
representation had the desired effect. A ludicrous degree
of consternation and alarm was depicted upon the faces
of all the traders, and they immediately made a common
concern of a subject which before they had treated with
very little attention. Two were immediately selected {133}
from their number, and were in a short time ready to
attend us. It is probable almost any other method of
punishment would have appeared to them less terrible.
Having been long resident among the Indians, they have
conformed to their mode of life, which certainly is not
without its charms to the uninformed and the idle. A tie
not less powerful is that of conjugal and paternal affection,
they having among the Indians wives and children relying
upon their exertions for protection and maintenance.</p>

<p>About the village we saw several parties of young men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
eagerly engaged at games of hazard. One of these, which
we noticed particularly, is played between two persons,
and something is staked on the event of each game. The
instruments used are a small hoop, about six inches in
diameter, which is usually wound with thongs of leather,
and a pole, five or six feet long, on the larger end of which
a limb is left to project about six inches. The whole bears
some resemblance to a shepherd's crook. The game is
played upon a smooth beaten path, at one end of which
the gamester commences, and running at full speed, he
first rolls from him the hoop, then discharges after it the
pole, which slides along the path, pursuing the hoop, until
both stop together, at a distance of about thirty yards from
the place whence they were thrown. After throwing them
from him, the gamester continues his pace, and the Indian,
the hoop, and the pole arrive at the end of the path about
the same time. The effort appears to be to place the end
of the pole either in the ring, or as near as possible; and
we could perceive that those casts were considered best
when the ring was caught by the hook at the end of the
pole. What constitutes a point, or how many points are
reckoned to the game, we could not ascertain. It is,
however, sufficiently evident that they are desperate gamesters,
often losing their ornaments, articles of dress, &amp;c.
at play.</p>

<p>{134} This game, like some of those described in a former
part of this work, requires considerable exertion, and is well
calculated for the exhibition of that gracefulness of figure,
and that ease and celerity of motion in which the savages
so far surpass their civilized neighbours. We saw many
young men engaged at these diversions, who had thrown
aside their robes, leggins, and all superfluous articles
of dress, displaying a symmetry of proportion, and beauty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
of form, which we have rarely seen surpassed. They were
so intent upon their diversion, that in some instances our
approach towards them, as we were rambling about the
village, did not for a moment call off their attention from
the game.</p>

<p>The population of the three Pawnee villages was estimated
by Captain Pike, in 1806, at 6,223, and they were
at that time supposed to be able to call into the field 1,993
warriors. At present it is believed they would fall short
of this estimate, particularly in the number of warriors.
They are, however, still numerous, and are said to be increasing,
and are respected by the Sioux, and other neighbouring
nations, as warlike and powerful.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<p>About the three villages are six or eight thousand horses,
feeding in the plains during the day, but confined at night.
These, with a breed of sharp-eared, meagre, wolf-like
dogs, are their only domestic animals. On the approach
of winter they conceal their stores of corn, dry pumpkins,
beans, &amp;c. and with their whole retinue of dogs and horses
desert their villages. This they are compelled to do from
the want of wood, not only for fuel, but for the support
of their numerous horses.</p>

<p>They encamp in their lodges of skins wherever the cotton
wood is found in sufficient quantities for their horses, and
game for themselves. The horses, in the country bordering
the Missouri, are fed during the winter, in the extensive
wooded bottoms of that river, and are not, therefore, confined
exclusively to {135} the cotton wood, having access
to other timber, also to the rushes and coarse grass which
abound in the bottoms. We are, however, well assured
that the Indian horses, farther to the west, about the upper
branches of the Platte, and Arkansa, subsist and thrive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
during the winter, with no other article of food than the
bark and branches of the cotton wood. The winter at
the Pawnee villages is said to be uncommonly severe, but
is probably little, if any more so, than at Council Bluff, on
the Missouri. Thermometric observations at Council
Bluff, and at St. Peters<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> on the Mississippi, prove that
the climate at these two places does not very widely differ
from that of the corresponding latitudes on the Atlantic
coast, except that it is at times something colder. The
vicissitudes of temperature appear to be equally great and
sudden.</p>

<p>The climate at Council Bluff is beyond the influence of
the south-western winds from the Gulf of Mexico, which
have been supposed to have so perceptible an effect to
soften the rigours of winter in the valley of the Lower
Mississippi. The three Pawnee villages, with their pasture
grounds and insignificant enclosures, occupy about
ten miles in length of the fertile valley of the Wolf river.
The surface is wholly naked of timber, rising gradually to
the river hills, which are broad and low, and from a mile
to a mile and an half distant. The soil of this valley is
deep and of inexhaustible fertility. The surface, to the
depth of two or three feet, is a dark coloured vegetable
mould intermixed with argillaceous loam, and still deeper,
with a fine siliceous sand. The agriculture of the Pawnees
is extremely rude. They are supplied with a few hoes by
the traders, but many of their labours are accomplished
with the rude instruments of wood and bone which their
own ingenuity supplies. They plant corn and pumpkins in
little patches along the sides of deep ravines, and wherever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
by any accident the grassy {136} turf has been eradicated.
Sometimes these little plantations are enclosed with a sort
of wicker fence, and in other instances are left entirely
open. These last are probably watched by the squaws
during the day time, when the horses run at large.</p>

<p>We slept on the night of 12th at our encampment in
front of the Pawnee Loup village. During the night all
remained at rest except the dogs, who howled in concert,
in the same voice, and nearly to the same tune, as the
wolves, to whose nightly serenade we were now accustomed.</p>

<p>As soon as the day dawned we observed the surrounding
plain filled with groups of squaws, with their small children,
trooping to their cornfields in every direction. Some,
who passed our encampment, lingered a moment to admire
our novel appearance; but the air of serious business
was manifest in their countenances, and they soon hurried
away to their daily labours. Some of the groups of young
females were accompanied by a jolly looking young man
as a protector. Their corn is usually gathered before it
is entirely ripe, it is then boiled, cut from the cob, and
dried. Their cookery consists in boiling it, either with
or without the tallow of the bison, according to the state
of their supplies. The pumpkins are cut in slips, which
are dried in the sun, and afterwards woven into mats for
the convenience of carrying. They offered us these articles
in exchange for tobacco, vermillion, beads, looking-glasses,
and various other trinkets. Also jerked bison beef, and
the tallow of that animal, of which we purchased a small
quantity. We saw among them the <i>pomme blanche</i>, as
called by the Canadian traders and boatmen, which is the
root of the Psoralea <i>esculenta</i>. It is eaten either boiled
or roasted, and somewhat resembles the sweet potato.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock, on the morning of the 13th, we commenced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
crossing the river, opposite the village. This we
found an undertaking of some difficulty, as {137} the current
was rapid, and the bottom partook something of the
nature of quick-sands. Major Long, Mr. Say, and one
or two others, who were riding at the head of our line, had
nearly crossed, and were wading their horses about midsides
deep in the water, when they were suddenly thrown
from their saddles by the sinking of their horses' feet in the
sand; the horses, however, extricated themselves by their
own exertion; and those of the party who had experienced
this unexpected immersion, were greeted, upon their standing
up in the water, by the shouts and acclamations of the
Pawnees who lined the shore we had left. Major Long's
gun and jacob-staff, as well as Mr. Say's gun, blanket, and
other articles, were dropped into the river; all of these were,
however, recovered except the blanket; and Mr. Say,
having lost the greater part of his furniture at the river of
Souls, by the ill-timed activity of his horse, was now, in a
great measure, unencumbered with baggage. At length,
by leading our horses, we arrived in safety on the opposite
shore, where we encamped, intending to make some
further barters with the Pawnees, and to dry some of our
baggage, guns, &amp;c. which had been wet in crossing.</p>

<p>The sand of this river, which in the aggregate, has a
very white appearance, consists principally of minute
grains of transparent quartz, mixed with some which are
red, yellow, and variously coloured. The shore, opposite
the Loup village, is covered with shrubs and other plants,
growing among the loose sands. One of the most common
is a large flowering rose, rising to about three feet
high, and diffusing a most grateful fragrance. The
Symphoria <i>glomerata</i>, common in all the country west of
the Mississippi thus far, is also a beautiful shrub very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
frequent at this place; the flowers are white, with a faint
and delicate tinge of red, having the inside of the corolla
densely villous, like the Mitchilla, to which plant it is
manifestly allied. On the hills, at {138} a little distance
from the river, we observed the <i>Cactus fragilis</i>. This
plant, which was first detected on the Missouri by Lewis
and Clark, has been accurately described by Mr. Nuttall.
The articulations or joints of which it consists, are small,
oblong, and tapering, but separate from each other with
great readiness, and adhere by means of the barbed spines,
with which they are thickly set, to whatever they may happen
to touch. This has led to a saying among the hunters,
that the plant grows without roots.</p>

<p>In the afternoon a young Indian belonging to the Arikara
nation on the Missouri, but who resided among the
Pawnees, stopped at our camp, on his return from a solitary
excursion to the Arkansa. He had brought with him,
from one of the upper branches of that river, two masses
of salt, each weighing about thirty pounds. This salt is
pure and perfect, consisting of large crystalline grains,
so concreted together as to form a mass about twenty
inches in diameter and six in thickness. It had evidently
been formed by the evaporation of water in some pond or
basin, and that surface of the mass, which was its lower
in its original position, was intermixed with red sand, indicating
the sort of soil in which it is found. Mr. Peale
procured some specimens in exchange for tobacco.</p>

<p>This Indian had been many days absent, on his excursion,
and as he sat upon his horse before our encampment
we had an opportunity to note a trait in the Indian character,
which has been the subject of remark by many
authors, and which we had previously observed in several
instances ourselves; we allude to the apparent coolness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
which friends, and the nearest relatives, observe to each
other when they meet after a long separation. Several of
his fellow townsmen, who were about our encampment,
hardly noticed him when he first appeared, and it was only
after the lapse of a considerable interval {139} that one of
them spoke to him, but without any visible ceremony of
greeting.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 14th, we left our encampment,
opposite the village of the Pawnee Loups, and proceeded
on our journey, taking the most direct course towards the
Platte. Our party had here received an addition of two
men, one named Bijeau, engaged as guide and interpreter,
the other, Ledoux, to serve as hunter, farrier, &amp;c. Both
were Frenchmen, residing permanently among the Pawnees,
and had been repeatedly on the head waters of the
Platte and Arkansa, for the purpose of hunting and trapping
beaver. Bijeau was partially acquainted with several
Indian languages; in particular, that of the Crow nation,
which is extensively understood by the western tribes, and,
by frequent intercourse with the savages he had gained
a complete knowledge of the language of signs, universally
current among them. The great number, and the wide
dissimilarity of the dialects of the aborigines render this
method of communication necessary to them, and it is not
surprising it should have arrived at considerable perfection
among tribes who, from their situation and manner of
life, must often find occasion to make use of it.</p>

<p>Besides these two men, a young Spaniard, a refugee from
some of the settlements of New Mexico, joined our party,
intending to accompany us as far as his fear of his own
countrymen would permit. He had probably been guilty
of some misdemeanor, which made it necessary to avoid
his former acquaintances, and, on this account, he could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
not be induced to accompany us into the neighbourhood
of the Spanish settlements. The Frenchmen brought with
them three horses and a mule, so that our party, which was
now supposed to be made up for the journey, consisted,
exclusive of the Spaniard, of twenty-two men, thirty-four
horses and mules, and two dogs.</p>

<p>{140} We were well armed and equipped, each man carrying
a yauger or rifle gun, with the exception of two or
three who had muskets; most of us had pistols, all tomahawks
and long knives, which we carried suspended at our
belts. We believed ourselves about to enter on a district
of country inhabited by lawless and predatory bands of
savages, where we should have occasion to make use, not
only of our arms, but of whatever share of courage and
hardihood we might chance to possess.</p>

<p>The country which we passed on the 14th, lying between
the Loup fork and the Platte, has a moderately hilly surface,
except that portion of it which comprises the bottom
lands of the two rivers. The ridges are of little elevation,
destitute of stone of any kind, and irregular in direction;
the soil is sandy and infertile. The high and barren parts
of this tract are occupied by numerous communities of the
Prairie dog or Louisiana marmot.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span></p>

<p>On arriving near the Platte we observed a species of
prickly pear (<i>Cactus ferox. N.</i>) to become very numerous.
It resembles the common prickly pear of New Jersey,
(<i>C. opuntia.</i>) but is larger, and protected by a more formidable
armature of thorns. Our Indian horses were so
well acquainted with this plant, and its properties, that
they used the utmost care to avoid stepping near it. The
flowers are of a sulphur yellow, and when fully expanded
are nearly as large as those of the garden p&aelig;ony, and
crowded together upon the summits of the terminal articulations
of which the plant consists. These articulations,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
(or segments contained between the joints,) are oblong
and flattened, being longer and thicker than a man's hand.
A second species, the <i>C. mamillaris, N.</i> occurs on the dry
sandy ridges between the Pawnee villages and the Platte.
The beautiful cristaria <i>coccinea. Ph.</i> (malva <i>coccinea. N.</i>)
is very frequent in the low plains along the Platte. Its
flowers {141} have nearly the aspect of those of the common
wild rose, except that they are more deeply coloured.</p>

<p>We arrived at the Platte, a little before sun-set, the distance
from the Pawnees being, according to our computation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
twenty-five miles. After entering the valley of the
river, we travelled several miles across an unvaried plain,
and at length passing down by a gradual descent of a few
feet, we came upon a second level tract, extending to the
river.</p>

<p>The soil of the first of these portions is a bed of sand,
intermixed with small water-worn pebbles and gravel;
that of the latter is more fertile, and produces a luxuriant
vegetation.</p>

<p>Our guide informed us that the Platte, opposite the
point where we entered its valley, contains an island which
is more than one day's journey across, and about thirty
miles in length.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>At no great distance from our camp, which was placed
immediately on the brink of the river, we found the body
of a horse lying dead in the edge of the water. The animal
had, in all probability, been recently lost by a war party of
Indians.</p>

<p>15th. Soon after leaving our camp we crossed a small
stream, tributary to the Platte, from the north. It is
called Great Wood river, and has some timber along its
banks.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p>Our provisions being nearly exhausted, two of the hunters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
were sent forward in search of game; but after some
time they rejoined the party, having killed nothing.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards a single bison was discovered some
miles ahead of the party, and travelling apparently in the
same direction. Four of our hunters, having disencumbered
their horses of all their baggage, spurred forward in
the pursuit, but none of them were able to overtake the
animal, except the young Spaniard, who came near enough
to wound it with an arrow; but his horse being exhausted,
he {142} was compelled to desist from the pursuit, and
suffer the bison to escape.</p>

<p>Having ascended the Platte about sixteen miles, we
halted, to make such a dinner as the condition of our stores
would allow; and here the Spaniard took his leave of us
to return to the Pawnees.</p>

<p>In the scenery of the Platte there is the utmost uniformity;
a broad plain, unvaried by any object on which the
eye can rest, lies extended before us; on our right are the
low and distant hills which bound the valley, and on our
left the broad Platte, studded with numerous small but
verdant islands. On these islands is usually a little timber,
which is not met with in other situations. We were
fortunate in finding, towards evening, an old Indian encampment,
where were poles, stakes, &amp;c. which had been
brought from the islands, and here we placed our camp.
Some antelopes were seen during the day, but so wild and
vigilant that all our efforts to take them proved unsuccessful.
Our supper, therefore, was not of the choicest kind,
and, what was infinitely more vexatious to us, was limited
in quantity.</p>

<p>On the following day we passed a number of prairie dog
villages, some of them extending from two to three miles
along the river. Though much in want of game, most of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
our exertions to take these animals were without success.
A number were killed, but we were able to possess ourselves
of no more than two of them. These we found to
be in good condition and well flavoured. Their flesh
nearly resembles that of the ground hog, or woodchuck
(Arctomys Marylandica.)</p>

<p>In some small ponds near the Platte we saw the common
species of pond weed (Potamogeton <i>natans</i> and P. <i>fluitans</i>.
Ph.) also the Utricularia longirostris, of Leconte, and
an interesting species of Myriophillum.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p>By observations at morning and evening the magnetic
variation was found thirteen and an half degrees{143} east.
In the middle of the day the heat was excessive, and we
were under the necessity of halting at a place where no
shade could be found to shelter us from the scorching rays
of the sun, except what was afforded by our tents, which
were set up for this purpose. Here we remained until 4
P. M. when we resumed our journey. We crossed towards
evening a small creek, three miles beyond which we arrived
at an old Indian camp, where we halted for the night. We
had not been long here before a tremendous storm of wind
assailed our tents with such violence, that it was only by
stationing ourselves outside, and holding the margin to the
ground, that we were able to keep them standing.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

<p>Two of the hunters who had been sent out during the
afternoon, returned to camp late in the evening, bringing
in a buck antelope, a highly acceptable acquisition to us,
as we had been for some time restricted to short commons.
The flesh we found palatable, being very similar in every
respect to that of the common deer.</p>

<p>We had proceeded but a few miles from our camp, on
the following morning, when we perceived a number of
antelopes, at a little distance in the prairie. Being on the
windward side of the party, they were not able, by their
sense of smelling, to inform themselves of the nature of the
danger which was approaching. One of them, leaving
his companions, came so near our line as to be within
the reach of a rifle ball, and was killed by Lieutenant
Swift.</p>

<p>The antelope possesses an unconquerable inquisitiveness,
of which the hunters often take advantage, to compass
the destruction of the animal. The attempt to
approach immediately towards them in the open plain,
where they are always found, rarely proves successful.
Instead of this, the hunter, getting as near the animal as is
practicable, without exciting alarm, conceals himself by
lying down, then fixing a handkerchief or cap upon the
end of his {144} ramrod, continues to wave it, still remaining
concealed. The animal, after a long contest between
curiosity and fear, at length approaches near enough to
become a sacrifice to the former.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p>In the afternoon a single bison was seen at the distance
of several miles, being the second since we had left the
Pawnee villages, which were now about a hundred miles
distant, and we were beginning to fear that the representations
of the Indians, in relation to the difficulty of procuring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
game to subsist so large a party as ours, would
prove true. We found, however, that every part of the
country, which we had recently passed, had, at no distant
period, been occupied by innumerable herds of bisons.
Their tracks and dung were still to be seen in vast numbers;
and the surface of the ground was strewed with
skulls and skeletons, which were yet undecayed.</p>

<p>At 4 o'clock P. M. we arrived at an old Indian encampment,
opposite an island, on which was some wood, and
perceiving that none would be met with for many miles
a-head, we determined to halt here for the night.</p>

<p>The 18th, being Sunday, we remained in camp. This
indulgence was not only highly acceptable to the soldiers
and men who accompanied us, they being much harassed
and fatigued by their exertions during the week, but was
necessary for our horses, which, not being in good condition
when we left the Missouri, were perceptibly failing
under the laborious services they were made to perform.
At our nightly encampments we found it necessary to confine
them, as we had not always a plentiful supply of grass
in the immediate vicinity of our camp, and if left at large
they would wander in search of better pasture, and occasion
us great trouble to collect them again in the morning.
Accordingly, long ropes had been provided, {145} which
were carried constantly on the necks of the horses, and by
these they were made fast during the night to stakes driven
into the ground. After having eaten all the grass within
his reach, the horse was removed to another place, and
this was done several times during the night, by a guard
kept constantly on duty, both for the performance of this
service, and also to give timely notice in case of the approach
of Indians to the camp. Notwithstanding this
care, on our part, our horses were sometimes but poorly fed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
as we were often compelled to encamp in places where
little grass was to be found. When we remained in camp
during the day, they were suffered to range more at liberty,
a watch being kept out to prevent their wandering too great
a distance. Notwithstanding the sabbath was devoted to
the refreshment of our horses, and the relaxation of the
men who accompanied us, some attention was given to
the great objects of the expedition. Astronomical observations
for the correction of our time-piece, and for other
purposes, were made. At Engineer Cantonment we had
furnished ourselves with portfolios of paper, to receive
specimens of such plants as we might collect; but we found
that the precautions which had been used to protect these
from the weather had been insufficient, some of our collections
being in part wet, and others having been made
during the heavy rains, which fell before we reached the
Pawnee villages, required much attention. The sabbath
also afforded us an opportunity to devote a little attention
to the important objects of personal cleanliness and comfort.
The plain about our encampment was strewed with
the bones of the bison, and other animals; and among the
rest we distinguished some of men. We picked up a
number of human skulls, one of which we thought it no
sacrilege to compliment with a place upon one of our pack-horses.
Our guides could give us no satisfactory information
of the time and manner in which the several persons,
{146} to whom these bones formerly belonged, had been
compelled to lay them down in this place; it is certain,
however, that at no very distant period, a battle had been
fought, or a massacre committed, on this spot.</p>

<p>We had now arrived at a point about two hundred miles
distant from the confluence of the Platte and Missouri,
yet the character of the former river was but little changed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
It was still from one to three miles in breadth, containing
numerous islands, covered with a scanty growth of cotton-wood
willows, the amorpha fruticosa, and other shrubs.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII_VI">{147} CHAPTER VIII {VI}</h2>

<p class="hang">The Platte—Desert Plains—Mirage—Arrival at the
Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Platte, called by the Otoes Ne-braska, (Flat river,
or water,) is, as its name imports, almost uniformly broad
and shoal. It is fordable at almost any place, except when
swollen by freshets, which occur in the spring season, from
the melting of snow, and occasionally during the other
portions of the year, from excessive rain. Its bed is composed
almost exclusively of sand, forming innumerable
bars, which are continually changing their position, and
moving downward, till at length they are discharged into
the Missouri, and swept away to the ocean by that rapid
and turbulent river.</p>

<p>The range of the Platte, from extreme low to extreme
high water is very inconsiderable, manifestly not exceeding
six or eight feet. This is about the usual height of its
banks above the surface of the sand which forms its bed.
The banks are sometimes overflowed, but evidently to no
great extent. The rapidity of the current, and the great
width of the bed of the river, preclude the possibility of any
extensive inundation of the surrounding country. The
bottom lands of the river rise by an imperceptible ascent
on each side, extending laterally to a distance of from two
to ten miles, where they are terminated by low ranges of
gravelly hills, running parallel to the general direction of
the river. Beyond these the surface is an undulating
plain, having an elevation of from fifty to one hundred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
feet, and presenting the aspect of hopeless and irreclaimable
sterility.</p>

<p>The Missouri, in compliance with the usage of boatmen,
hunters, &amp;c., has been usually considered under two
divisions; the lower extending from the {148} Mississippi
to the confluence of the Platte, and the upper, comprehending
all above that point. As might be expected, the
influx of so large and so peculiar a river as the Platte, gives
a new character to the Missouri below. It is more rapid,
more difficult of navigation, and the water more turbid
than above.</p>

<p>Among other plants observed about our encampment,
was the wild liquorice, (glycyrhiza lepidota, N.) which is
believed to be the plant mentioned by Sir A. Mackenzie,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>
which is used as food by the savages of the north-west.
The root is large and long, spreading horizontally to a
great distance. In taste it bears a very slight resemblance
to the liquorice of the shops, but is bitter and nauseous.
The leaves are frequently covered with a viscid exudation.</p>

<p>We were prevented from continuing our astronomical
observations, in the afternoon, the weather becoming
cloudy, and at evening a thunder-storm commenced, which
continued with short intermissions during the night. The
lightning exhibited an incessant glare, and peals of thunder
which seemed to shake the earth to its centre, followed
each other in rapid succession.</p>

<p>On Monday the 19th, we moved on, and ascending
the Platte about thirty miles, arrived in the evening at a
place where the hills on the north side close in, quite to the
bed of the river. On both sides they became more
broken and elevated, and on the north, they approached
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
so near to the bed of the Platte, that we were under the
necessity of travelling across them. We were glad, however,
of any change of scene. The monotony of a vast
unbroken plain, like that in which we had now travelled
nearly one hundred and fifty miles, is little less tiresome
to the eye, and fatiguing to the spirit, than the dreary
solitude of the ocean.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<p>With this change of the surface, some change is observed
in the vegetable products of the soil. Here {149} we first
saw a new species of prickly poppy,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> with a spreading
white flower, as large as that of the common poppy of the
gardens. The aspect of this plant is very similar to that
of the common poppy, except that the leaves are covered
with innumerable large and strong prickles. When
wounded it exudes a thick yellowish sap, intensely bitter
to the taste. On the summits of some of the dry sandy
ridges, we saw a few of the plants called Adam's needles,
(yucca angustifolia) thriving with an appearance of luxuriance
and verdure, in a soil which bids defiance to almost
every other species of vegetation. Nature has, however,
fitted the yucca for the ungenial soil it is destined to
occupy. The plant consists of a large tuft of rigid spear-pointed
leaves, placed immediately upon the root, and
sending up in the flowering season, a stalk bearing a
cluster of lilliaceous flowers as large as those of the common
tulip of the gardens. The root bears more resemblance
to the trunk of a tree, than to the roots of ordinary
plants. It is two or three inches in diameter, descending
undivided to a great depth below the surface, where it is
impossible the moisture of the earth should ever be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
exhausted, and there terminates in numerous spreading
branches. In some instances, the sand is blown from
about the root, leaving several feet of it exposed, and
supporting the dense leafy head, at some distance from
the surface.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>Several bisons and other game, had been seen in the
course of the day, but nothing taken. As our provisions
were now exhausted, it was resolved to remain encamped
where we were, while parties were sent out in different
directions to hunt.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p>Being now at a place where, as our guide informed us,
the Pawnees often cross the Platte, and as it was our
intention to ascend on the other side of the river, Major
Long rode across to ascertain the practicability {150} of
fording; but the summer freshet being now at its height,
it was found the river could not be crossed without swimming,
and the design was relinquished. Six of our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
party, including the hunters, were sent out in pursuit of
game.</p>

<p>At camp, observations were taken for ascertaining
longitude and other purposes. At evening, Mr. Peale
returned, having killed an antelope at the distance of ten
miles from the camp, and brought it within about four,
where being fatigued and hungry, he had made a fire,
cooked and ate part of the animal, and left the remainder,
suspending a handkerchief near it, to protect it from the
wolves. Soon afterwards others returned, and when all
were collected, it appeared there had been killed one
bison, two antelopes, and a hare, all at a distance from
camp. Horses were accordingly sent out to bring in the
meat, a part of which we attempted to dry during the
night, by cutting it in thin pieces and exposing it over a slow
fire, but a storm of wind and rain, which continued greater
part of the night, prevented our success in this attempt.</p>

<p>21st. The storm continued throughout the night,
and the following day was cold, with a heavy mist from
the south-east.</p>

<p>After travelling this day our customary distance, which
was about twenty-five miles, we were compelled to halt
at a place where we could find no poles to set up our
tents. We were fortunate in finding part of a tree which
had drifted down the Platte, and which sufficed to make
a fire for the cooking of our supper. An Indian dog,
who had made his appearance at the encampment on the
preceding day, had followed us thus far, but kept aloof,
not allowing us to come within one or two hundred yards
of him.</p>

<p>On the following morning, six miles from our camp,
we arrived at the confluence of the north and south fork
of the Platte. We had halted here, and were making
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
preparations to examine the north fork, with a view of
crossing it, when we saw two elk plunge into the river
a little above us on the same {151} side. Perceiving it
was their design to cross the river, we watched them
until they arrived on the other side, which they did
without swimming. We accordingly chose the same
place they had taken, and putting a part of our baggage
in a skin canoe, waded across, leading our horses, and
arrived safely on the other side; no accident having
happened, except the wetting of such of our baggage as
was left on the horses.</p>

<p>The north fork at its confluence is about eight hundred
yards wide, is shoal and rapid like the Platte, and has a
sandy bed. We were informed by our guide, who had
been repeatedly to its sources, that it rises within the
Rocky Mountains, about one hundred and twenty miles
north of the sources of the Platte.</p>

<p>It is probably the river which was mistaken by Captain
Pike for the Yellow-stone, and has been laid down as
such on his map, whence the mistake has been copied
into several others. It has its source in numerous small
streams, which descend from the hill surrounding a
circumscribed valley within the mountains, called the
Bull-pen. This basin is surrounded by high and rugged
mountains, except at the place where the north fork
passes into the plains. On each side of this strait, or pass,
are high and abrupt rocky promontories, which confine
the river to a narrow channel. The diameter of the
circumscribed valley, called the Bull-pen, is one day's
travel, about twenty miles.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> The upper branches of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
the north fork have some timber, mostly cotton-wood and
willow, and abound in beaver.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>

<p>From the limited information communicated to the
public, on the subject of Mr. Hunt's Expedition to the
mouth of the Columbia, commenced in the year 1811, it
appears that a part of the men engaged in that undertaking,
in their return from the Pacific, crossed the
Rocky Mountains from some one of the upper branches
of Lewis' river, and falling upon the sources of the north
fork of the Platte, descended thence to the Missouri.</p>

<p>{152} On the 28th of June, 1812, Mr. Robert Stewart,
one of the partners of the Pacific Fur Company, with
two Frenchmen, M'Clellan, and Crooks, left the Pacific
ocean with despatches for New York.</p>

<p>Having proceeded about seven hundred miles, they
met Mr. Joseph Miller, on his way to the mouth of the
Columbia. He had been considerably to the south and
east, and had fallen in with the Black-arms, and the
Arrapahoes, who wander about the sources of the Arkansa.
By the latter of these he had been robbed, in consequence
of which he was now reduced to starvation and nakedness.</p>

<p>Mr. Stewart and his companions had fifteen horses,
but soon afterwards met with a band of the Crow Indians,
near the Rocky Mountains, who behaved with the most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
unbounded insolence, and finally stole every horse belonging
to the party.</p>

<p>They now found themselves on foot, with the Rocky
Mountains, and a journey of two thousand miles before
them; fifteen hundred of which was through a country
wholly unknown, as their route lay considerably to the
south of that of Lewis and Clarke.</p>

<p>Putting the best face upon their prospects, they pursued
their journey towards the Rocky Mountains, travelling
east-south-east, until they struck the "head waters
of the great river Platte," which they followed to its
mouth, having spent the winter upon it, six hundred
miles from the Missouri.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<p>The confluence of the north fork and the Platte is,
according to our estimate of distances, one hundred and
forty-nine miles by our courses, from the Pawnee Loup
village.</p>

<p>Some of the upper branches of the Wolf river head
about thirty miles to the north of this point.</p>

<p>After fording the north fork, we crossed a narrow
point of low prairie to the Platte, where, as it was {153}
now near night, we resolved to encamp, and attempt the
passage of the river on the following day.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>Our view of the opposite margin of the Platte, during
this day's march, had been intercepted by an elevated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
swell of the surface, which extended along, parallel to
the river, that we were now approaching. Immediately
upon surmounting this undulation we saw before us,
upon the broad expanse of the left margin of the river,
immense herds of bisons, grazing in undisturbed possession,
and obscuring, with the density of their numbers, the
verdant plain; to the right and left, as far as the eye
was permitted to rove, the crowd seemed hardly to
diminish, and it would be no exaggeration to say, that at
least ten thousand here burst on our sight in the instant.
Small columns of dust were occasionally wafted by the
wind from bulls that were pawing the earth, and rolling;
the interest of action was also communicated to the scene,
by the unwieldy playfulness of some individuals, that the
eye would occasionally rest upon, their real or affected
combats, or by the slow or rapid progress of others to and
from their watering places. On the distant bluffs, individuals
were constantly disappearing, whilst others were
presenting themselves to our view, until, as the dusk of
the evening increased, their massive forms, thus elevated
above the line of other objects, were but dimly defined
on the skies. We retired to our evening fare, highly
gratified with the novel spectacle we had witnessed, and
with the most sanguine expectations of the future.</p>

<p>In the morning we again sought the living picture, but
upon all the plain which last evening was so teeming with
noble animals, not one remained. We forded the Platte
with less delay and difficulty than we had encountered
in crossing the north fork.</p>

<p>It is about nine hundred yards wide, and very rapid,
but so shoal that we found it unnecessary to dismount
from our horses, or to unpack the mules. {154} We
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
found the plains on the south side of the Platte more
closely depastured than those we had before seen. The
grass is fine and short, forming a dense and matted turf,
as in the oldest pastures.</p>

<p>Meeting with wood at about three o'clock <small>P. M.</small>, we
resolved to encamp. On the two preceding evenings, we
had found it difficult to collect as much wood as sufficed
to kindle a fire, which was afterwards kept up with the
dung of the bison, though not without some difficulty, as
the weather was rainy.</p>

<p>The dung of the bison is used as fuel in many parts of
the woodless country southwest of the Missouri, by the
Indians, and by hunters, who often encamp where no
wood is to be found. We learn from Sonnini<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> and
others, that the excrement of the camel, mixed with
chopped straw and afterwards dried, is similarly used in
the woodless parts of Egypt.</p>

<p>The hills on the south side of the Platte, above the
confluence of the north fork, become more abrupt and
elevated, approaching in character those of the Missouri
which are destitute of stone. There is here the same
transcript of Alpine scenery, in miniature, which constitutes
so striking a feature in the Missouri landscape,
when viewed from the river bottom.</p>

<p>We had no sooner crossed the Platte, than our attention
was arrested by the beautiful white primrose (œnothera
pinnatifida, N.) with its long and slender corolla reclining
upon the grass. The flower, which is near two inches
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
long, constitutes about one-half of the entire length of
the plant.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>The valley of the Platte, above the forks, is much
narrower, and a little more irregular in direction than
below, and is frequently interrupted by small hills running
in towards the river. On ascending these hills, we found
them of a coarse sand, and containing more gravel and
small pebbles than below. Among the gravel stones,
small fragments of flesh-coloured {155} felspar are distinguished.
About the summits of the hills we saw some
detached pieces of fine carnelion, with agates and calcedony.</p>

<p>We had often examined, with some anxiety, the turbid
waters of the Platte, hoping thereby to gain information
respecting the predominating rock formations of the
mountainous district, from which that river descends.</p>

<p>It had been a received opinion among some of the
geologists of the United States, that the Rocky Mountains
were not of primitive rocks; we had hitherto observed
nothing which could either confirm or invalidate this
opinion.</p>

<p>The great alluvial formation, which occupies the
country on both sides of the lower portion of the river
Platte, is an almost unmixed siliceous sand, in no manner
distinguishable from the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the sandstones of
transition mountains. Near the forks of the Platte, we
first observed that the waters of that river bring down,
among other matters, numerous small scales of mica.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
This also is a constituent of the sandstones of the lower
secondary or transition formations. The fragments of
unmixed and crystalline felspar, which now began to be
of frequent occurrence, were considered as the first convincing
evidence of the primitive character of the Rocky
Mountains. These fragments of felspar, we believed,
could have been derived from no other than primitive
rocks.</p>

<p>During all the day on the 23d we travelled along the
south side of the Platte, our course inclining something
more towards the south-west than heretofore.</p>

<p>Intermixed in the narrow fringe of timber, which
marks the course of the river, are very numerous trees,
killed by the action of the beaver or by the effects of old
age; their decorticated and bleached trunks and limbs
strongly contrasting with the surrounding objects, many
of them rendered doubly {156} interesting by affording
a support to the nests of the bald eagle, elevated like a
beacon in the horizon of the traveller.</p>

<p>Large herds of bisons were seen in every direction;
but as we had already killed a deer, and were supplied
with meat enough for the day, none of the party were
allowed to go in pursuit of them. Prickly pears became
more and more abundant as we ascended the river; and
here they occurred in such extensive patches as considerably
to retard our progress, it being wholly impracticable
to urge our horses across them. The cactus ferox is the
most common, and, indeed, the only species which is of
frequent occurrence. It has been stated by a traveller
to the Upper Missouri,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> that the antelope, which inhabits
the extensive plains of that river and its tributaries, finds
means to make this plant, notwithstanding its terrific
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
armature of thorns, subservient to its necessities, "by
cutting it up with his hoofs." We were able to discover
no confirmation of this statement; it may, however, be
applicable to some plains more arid and sterile than any
we have passed, where the antelopes may be driven by
necessity to the use of this hard expedient.</p>

<p>On the following day we saw immense herds of bisons,
blackening the whole surface of the country through which
we passed. At this time they were in their summer coat.
From the shoulders backwards, all the hinder parts of the
animal are covered with a growth of very short and fine
hair, as smooth and soft to the touch as a piece of velvet.
The tail is very short, and tufted at the end, and its services,
as a fly-brush, are confined to a very limited surface.</p>

<p>The fore parts of the body are covered with long shaggy
hair, descending in a tuft behind the knee, in a distinct
beard beneath the lower jaw, rising in a dense mass on
the top of his head as high as the tip of the horns, matted
and curled on his front so {157} thickly as to deaden the
force of the rifle-ball, which rebounds from the forehead,
or lodges in the hair, causing the animal only to shake his
head as he bounds heavily onward. The head is so large
and ponderous, in proportion to the size of the body,
that the supporting muscles, which greatly enlarge the
neck, form over the shoulders, where they are imbedded
on each side of elongated vertebral processes, distinguished
by the name of hump ribs, a very considerable elevation
called the hump, which is of an oblong form, diminishing
in height as it recedes, so as to give considerable obliquity
to the line of the back. The eye is small, black, and
piercing; the horns, which are black, and remarkably
robust at base, curve outward and upward, tapering
rapidly to the tip. The profile of the face is somewhat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
convexly curved; and the superior lip, on each side,
papillous within, is dilated and extended downward, so
as to give a very oblique appearance to the lateral rictus,
or gape of the mouth, considerably resembling in this
respect the ancient architectural bas-reliefs representing
the heads of the ox. The physiognomy is menacing and
ferocious, and the whole aspect of the animal is sufficiently
formidable to influence the spectator who is, for the first
time, placed near him in his native wilds, with certain
feelings which indicate the propriety of immediate attention
to personal safety.</p>

<p>The bison cow bears the same relation, as to appearance,
to the bull, that the domestic cow does to her mate;
she is smaller, with much less hair on the anterior part of
her body, and though she has a conspicuous beard, yet
this appendage is comparatively short; her horns also are
much less robust, and not partially concealed by hair.</p>

<p>The dun colour prevails on the coat of the bison; but
the long hair of the anterior part of the body, with the
exception of the head, is more or less tinged with yellowish
or rust colour. The uniformity of {158} colour, however,
amongst these animals is so steadfast, that any considerable
deviation from the ordinary standard is regarded by
the natives as effected under the immediate influence of
the Divinity.</p>

<p>A trader of the Missouri informed us that he had seen
a grayish-white bison, and that another, a yearling calf,
was distinguished by several white spots on the side, and
by a white frontal mark and white fore feet.</p>

<p>Mr. J. Dougherty saw in an Indian hut a bison head,
very well prepared, which had a white star on the front;
the owner valued it highly, calling it his great medicine;
he could not be tempted to part with it; "for," said he,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
"the herds come every season into the vicinity to seek
their white-faced companion."</p>

<p>They are the skins of the cows almost exclusively that
are used in commerce; those of the bulls being so large,
heavy, and difficult to prepare, that this is comparatively
seldom attempted.</p>

<p>That the bison formerly ranged over the Atlantic
states there can be no doubt; and Lawson informs us that
even in his time some were killed in Virginia; and Cumming,
in his Sketches of a Tour to the Western Country,
informs us that, "long after the country (Kentucky) began
to be generally settled, and ceased to be a hunting ground
by the Indians," the "buffaloes, bears, and deer, were so
plenty in the country that little or no bread was used,"
and "the facility of gaining them prevented the progress
of agriculture, until the poor innocent buffaloes were
completely extirpated, and the other wild animals much
thinned."<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> This process of extirpation has not since
been relaxed, and the bison is now driven beyond the
lakes, the Illinois, and southern portion of the Mississippi
rivers, their range extending from the country west of
Hudson's bay to the northern provinces of Mexico.
They have not yet crossed the entire breadth of the
mountains at the {159} head of the Missouri, though they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
penetrate, in some parts, far within that range, to the
most accessible fertile valleys, particularly the valley of
Lewis' river. It was there that Mr. Henry and his party
of hunters wintered, and subsisted chiefly upon the flesh
of these animals, which they saw in considerable herds;
but the Indians affirmed that it was unusual for the
bisons to visit that neighbourhood.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p>All the mountains which we ascended were more or
less strewed with the dung of these animals about the
lower parts; a conclusive evidence that this portion of the
range had been traversed by the bisons.</p>

<p>The cows remain fat from July to the latter part of
December. The rutting season occurs towards the
latter part of July, and continues until the beginning of
September, after which month the cows separate from
the bulls, in distinct herds, and bring forth their calves in
April. The calves seldom separate themselves from the
mother under the age of one year; and cows are often
seen accompanied by the calves of three seasons.</p>

<p>The meat of the bison has often been compared with
that of the domestic ox, and the preference yielded to the
latter, as an article of food. This decision, however, we
cannot, from our experience confirm; it appeared to us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
that although of a somewhat coarser fibre, yet, after
making due allowance for the situation in which we were
placed, our appetites often increased by hunger and
privation, that the flesh of the bison is in no degree
inferior in delicacy and sweetness to that of the common
ox. But that the flesh of those which we were accustomed
to eat was more agreeably sapid than that which formed
a subject of comparison to the authors alluded to, is
altogether possible, as the grass upon which they usually
fed was short, firm, and nutritious, considerably differing
in its nature from the luxuriant and less solid grass
nourished by a fertile soil. It was {160} preferred by the
party to the flesh of the elk or deer, which was thrown
away when it could be substituted by the bison meat.</p>

<p>To the fat of the bison we conceded a decided superiority
over that of the common ox, as being richer and
sweeter to the taste.</p>

<p>As our stock of provision was nearly exhausted, permission
was given, when we had arrived near a suitable
place for our mid-day halt, to the hunters to go out in
pursuit of bisons, and in a short time two were killed.
The choice parts of these were taken and placed upon
pack-horses, to be carried forward to our next encampment,
where some of it might be <i>jerked</i> on the ensuing
day, which was Sunday.</p>

<p>Aside from the vast herds of bisons which it contains,
the country along the Platte is enlivened by great numbers
of deer, badgers,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> hares,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> prairie wolves, eagles, buzzards,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>
ravens, and owls: these, with its rare and interesting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
plants, in some measure relieved the uniformity of
its cheerless scenery. We found a constant source of
amusement in observing the unsightly figure, the cumbrous
gait, and impolitic movements of the bison; we
were often delighted by the beauty and fleetness of the
antelope, and the social comfort and neatness of the
prairie dog.</p>

<p>This barren and ungenial district appeared, at this
time, to be filled with greater numbers of animals than
its meagre productions are sufficient to support. It was,
however, manifest that the bisons, then thronging in such
numbers, were moving towards the south. Experience
may have taught them to repair at certain seasons to the
more luxuriant plains of Arkansa and Red river. What
should ever prompt them to return to the inhospitable
deserts of the Platte, it is not perhaps, easy to conjecture.
In whatever {161} direction they move, their parasites
and dependants fail not to follow. Large herds are
invariably attended by gangs of meagre, famine-pinched
wolves, and flights of obscene and ravenous birds.</p>

<p>We have frequently remarked broad shallow excavations
in the soil, of the diameter of from five to eight
feet, and greatest depth from six inches to eighteen. These
are of rare occurrence near the Missouri, as far as Engineer
cantonment, and in other districts where the bison
is seldom seen at the present day; and when they do
exist there, they are overgrown by grass and nearly
obliterated. As you approach the country, still the
constant residence of these animals, the excavations
become more numerous, and are less productive of grass.
They now are so numerous as to be of constant recurrence,
offering a considerable impediment to the traveller, who
winds his way amongst them, and are entirely destitute
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
of grass, their surface being covered with a deep dust.
Until recently, we had no opportunity to observe the
cause which gives rise to these appearances; but we were
now convinced that they were the result of the habit
which the bulls have, in common with the domestic bull,
of scraping up the earth with their fore feet, in the process
of dusting themselves: they serve also as places for rolling
and wallowing; a gratification which the bison bull
indulges in as frequently, and in the same manner as
the horse.</p>

<p>Some extensive tracts of land along the Platte, particularly
those portions which are a little elevated, with
an undulating or broken surface, are almost exclusively
occupied by a scattered growth of several species of wormwood,
(artemisia) some of which are common to this
country, and that on the lower Missouri: we may enumerate
the following—A. ludoviciana, A. longifolia, A.
serrata, A. columbiensis,<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> {162} A. cernua, A. canadensis;
most of these species have simple or finely divided compound
leaves, which are long and slender, and canescent,
like those of the A. absynthium, the common wormwood
of the gardens. The peculiar aromatic scent, and the
flavor of this well known plant, is recognized in all the
species we have mentioned. Several of them are eaten
by the bisons, and our horses were sometimes reduced
to the necessity of feeding upon them.</p>

<p>The intense reflection of light and heat from the surface
of many tracts of naked sand, which we crossed, added
much to the fatigue and suffering of our journey. We often
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
met with extensive districts covered entirely with loose
and fine sand blown from the adjacent hills. In the low
plains along the river, where the soil is permanent, it is
highly impregnated with saline substances, and too sterile
to produce any thing except a few stinted carices and
rushes.</p>

<p>On the evening of the twenty-fourth, after we had
encamped, several bull bisons, being on the windward
side, came so near us as to create a disturbance among
our horses, who were not yet so familiarized to the formidable
appearance of those animals, as to regard their
near approach with indifference. The bulls at length
became troublesome, approaching so near to smell at the
horses, that some of the latter broke the cords by which
they were fastened, and made their escape. A man was
then sent to frighten away the bisons, who, in their turn,
exhibited as much terror as they had occasioned to our
horses.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the twenty-fifth, we remained encamped,
and some of the men were employed in drying a part of
the meat killed on the preceding day. {163} This was
done that we might be able to carry constantly with us a
small supply of provisions, in reserve against any occasion
when we might not meet with game.</p>

<p>The magnetic variation equated from two sets of
observations, was found to be 14&deg; east. Observations
for longitude were made; it was also attempted to take
the meridian altitude of Antares for ascertaining the
latitude, but the observation was commenced a few
minutes too late, we having been longer occupied in making
the preceding observations than we had anticipated.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span></p>

<p>26th. The weather had now been for some days fair.
As we approached the mountains, we felt or fancied, a
very manifest change in the character of the weather, and
the temperature of the air. Mornings and evenings were
usually calm, and the heat more oppressive than in the
middle of the day. Early in the forenoon, a light and
refreshing breeze often sprung up, blowing from the west
or south-west, which again subsided on the approach of
night. This phenomenon was so often observed that we
were induced to attribute it to the operation of the same
local cause, which in the neighbourhood of the sea, produces
a diurnal change in the winds, which blow alternately
to and from the shore. The Rocky Mountains
may be considered as forming the shore of that sea of
sand, which is traversed by the Platte, and extends
northward to the Missouri, above the great bend.</p>

<p>The rarefaction of the air over this great plain, by the
reverberation of the sun's rays during the day, causes an
ascending current, which is supplied by the rushing down
of the condensed air from the mountains. Though the
sun's rays in the middle of the day were scorching and
extremely afflictive to our eyes, the temperature of the air,
as indicated by the thermometer, had hitherto rarely
exceeded 80&deg; Fah.</p>

<p>{164} In the forenoon we passed a range of hills more
elevated than any we had seen west of the Missouri. These
hills cross the Platte from north to south, and though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
inconsiderable in magnitude, they can be distinguished
extending several miles on each side of the river. They
consist principally of gravel, intermixed with small water-worn
fragments of granite and other primitive rocks, but
are based on a stratum of coarse friable sand-stone, of a
dark gray colour, which has been uncovered, and cut
through by the bed of the Platte.</p>

<p>This range may perhaps be a continuation or spur
from the black hills mentioned by Lewis and Clarke, as
containing the sources of the Shienne, and other tributaries
to the Missouri, at no great distance to the north of the
place where we now were.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<p>At evening we arrived at another scattering grove of
cotton-wood trees, among which we placed our camp,
immediately on the brink of the river. The trees of which
these insulated groves are usually composed, from their
low and branching figure, and their remoteness from each
other, as they stand scattered over the soil they occupy,
revived strongly in our minds the appearance and gratifications
resulting from an apple orchard; for which from
a little distance they might readily be mistaken, if seen in
a cultivated region. At a few rods distant on our right
hand, was a fortified Indian camp, which appeared to
have been recently occupied. It was constructed of such
broken half-decayed logs of wood as the place afforded,
intermixed with some skeletons of bisons recently killed.
It is of a circular form, enclosing space enough for about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
thirty men to lie down upon. The wall is about five feet
high, with an opening towards the east, and the top
uncovered.</p>

<p>At a little distance in front of the entrance of this
breastwork, was a semicircular row of sixteen bison
skulls, with their noses pointing down the river. Near
the centre of the circle which this row would {165} describe,
if continued, was another skull marked with a number of
red lines.</p>

<p>Our interpreter informed us that this arrangement of
skulls and other marks here discovered, were designed
to communicate the following information, namely, that
the camp had been occupied by a war party of the Skeeree
or Pawnee Loup Indians, who had lately come from an
excursion against the Cumancias, Ietans, or some of the
western tribes. The number of red lines traced on the
painted skull indicated the number of the party to have
been thirty-six; the position in which the skulls were
placed, that they were on their return to their own country.
Two small rods stuck in the ground, with a few hairs
tied in two parcels to the end of each, signified that four
scalps had been taken.</p>

<p>A record of facts, which may be important and interesting
to others, is thus left for the benefit of all who may
follow. For our part we were glad to be informed, that
one lawless and predatory band of savages had lately left
the country we were about to traverse. We were never
without some anxiety on the subject of Indian war-parties;
who are known frequently to remunerate themselves for
any discomfiture or loss they may have sustained, by
making free booty of the property and the scalps of the
first weak or unguarded party they may meet.</p>

<p>At a late hour in the night, after our camp had become
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
quiet, we were suddenly awakened by a loud rushing
noise, which in a moment seemed to reach the centre of
our encampment; immediately a piercing exclamation
of terror was heard from one of our interpreters, which,
from the peculiarity of its tone, seemed to have escaped
from a throat under the grasp of death. It became
immediately apparent that the cause of the alarm proceeded
from our horses, all of whom had broken loose
from their stakes, near the Indian fort, and had run in a
state of fright through our camp, with the apparent desire
to gain our protection {166} against something in their
rear. We proceeded in a cautious manner to reconnoitre
the environs of the camp, stooping low, in order that the
eye might be directed along the level of the top of the
grass, which was here of a very luxuriant growth, in order
to detect in the gloom, any inimical object that might
rise above it; having thus convinced ourselves that
nothing dangerous to our safety remained very near to
us, the horses were again secured, and we betook ourselves
to our beds, with the reflection, that they had
probably been alarmed by the too near approach of
bisons.</p>

<p>We had scarce fallen asleep, when we were aroused
the second time, by the discharge of a gun close to our
tent. This was the signal which we had all understood
was to be given by the sentinel, in case of the hostile
approach of Indians to the camp. We therefore bestirred
ourselves, being well assured we had other business at
hand, than the securing of horses. Several of the party
went to reconnoitre the old fort above mentioned, but
nothing was discovered and they returned.</p>

<p>After all were assembled at camp, Major Long informed
us the alarm had been given by his order, and was intended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
to test the coolness and self-possession of the
party, and to prepare us in some measure for an unpleasant
occurrence, we all thought too likely to happen,
which was no other than a serious attack from the Indians,
to be made according to their custom at that highly
unseasonable hour of the morning.</p>

<p>Since leaving the Missouri, we had never indulged a
disposition to sluggishness, accustoming ourselves to
rise every morning long before the sun; but we still found
we left that small spot of earth, on which we had rested
our limbs, and which had become warm and dry by the
heat of our bodies, with as much reluctance as we have
felt at quitting softer beds.</p>

<p>{167} The mode of rallying now prescribed was the
following; immediately after an alarm should be given,
the party should seize their arms, and form in front of the
tents, in the rear of the line of packs, and await any orders
that might be given. The sentinel giving the alarm
should proceed to the tent of the officers, in order to
acquaint them with the cause. Major Long and Captain
Bell should reconnoitre about the encampment, and if
practicable ascertain the real occasion of the alarm.
Farther movements to be regulated as the emergency
might require.</p>

<p>This alarm was the occasion of our starting on the
morning of the 26th at an earlier hour than usual. We
rode on through the same uninteresting and dreary
country as before, but were constantly amused at observing
the motions of the countless thousands of bisons, by
which we were all the time surrounded. The wind
happening to blow fresh from the south, the scent of our
party was borne directly across the Platte, and we could
distinctly note every step of its progress through a distance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
of eight or ten miles, by the consternation and terror it
excited among the buffaloes. The moment the tainted
gale infected their atmosphere, they ran with as much
violence as if pursued by a party of mounted hunters,
and instead of running from the danger, turned their
heads towards the wind; eager to escape from the terrifying
scent, they pushed forward in an oblique direction
towards our party, and plunging into the river they swam
and waded, and ran with the utmost violence, in several
instances breaking through our line of march, which was
immediately along the left bank of the Platte.</p>

<p>It is remarked by hunters, and appears to be an established
fact, that the odour of a white man is more terrifying
to wild animals, particularly the bison, than that of an
Indian. This animal, in the course of its periodic migrations,
comes into the immediate {168} neighbourhood of
the permanent Indian villages, on the Missouri and the
Platte. One was seen by our hunters within six miles of the
Grand Pawnee village, and immediately about the towns
we saw many heads and skeletons of such as had been
killed there the preceding spring. They had come in
while the Pawnees were absent on their winter's hunt,
and at their return, we were informed, they found the
bisons immediately about their villages. They disappeared
invariably from the neighbourhood of the white
settlements within a few years. We are aware that
another cause may be found for this than the frightful
scent of the white man, which is, the impolitic exterminating
war which he wages against all unsubdued
animals within his reach.</p>

<p>It would be highly desirable that some law for the
preservation of game might be extended to, and rigidly
enforced in the country where the bison is still met with;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
that the wanton destruction of these valuable animals,
by the white hunters, might be checked or prevented.
It is common for hunters to attack large herds of these
animals, and having slaughtered as many as they are
able, from mere wantonness and love of this barbarous
sport, to leave the carcasses to be devoured by the wolves
and birds of prey; thousands are slaughtered yearly, of
which no part is saved except the tongues. This inconsiderate
and cruel practice is undoubtedly the principal
reason why the bison flies so far and so soon from the
neighbourhood of our frontier settlements.</p>

<p>It is well known to those in the least degree conversant
with the Indians, that the odour which their bodies
exhale, though very strong and peculiar, is by no means
unpleasant,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> at least to most persons. A negro in the
employment of the Missouri Fur Company, and living
at Fort Lisa, was often heard to complain of the intolerable
scent of the squaws; in like manner, the Indians find the
odour of a white man extremely offensive. In the language
of the {169} Peruvian Indians, are three words to
express their idea of the smell of the European, the
aboriginal American, and the negro. They call the first
<i>Pezuna</i>, the second <i>Posco</i>, and the third <i>Grajo</i>.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p>After passing the range of hills above mentioned, the
surface subsides nearly to a plain, having, however,
manifestly a greater inclination than below. The velocity
of the current of the river is much increased, the bed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
narrower, and the banks more precipitous. We passed
several extensive tracts nearly destitute of vegetation. The
surface of these consisted entirely of coarse sand and
gravel, with here and there an insulated mass of clay,
highly impregnated with salt, and gnawed and licked into
various singular shapes, exhibiting the forms of massive
insulated columns, huge buttresses, prominent angles,
and profound excavations, fortuitously mingled, and
which are now gradually diminishing, under the action
of the cause which produced them. The present surface
upon which they repose, seems to be a stratum of a
different earth, which does not afford the condiment so
attractive to the animals; the consequence is, that the
licking and chewing, principally, heretofore, affecting
the surface on which the animal stood, is now directed
against the upright portions of this singular grand excavation,
and most remarkable of all known salt-licks.</p>

<p>Some extensive portions of the immediate bottom
land, along the river, were white with an effloresced salt,
but this being impure and but imperfectly soluble, did
not appear to have been licked.</p>

<p>Towards evening we passed two springs of transparent,
but impure and brackish water. They were the
first we had met with on the Platte.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> Among a considerable
number of undescribed plants collected on the
27th, are three referable to the family of the rough-leaved
plants (asperifoli&aelig;), one of them belonging {170} to a
genus not heretofore known in the United States. It has
a salver-form corolla, with a large spreading angular,
plaited border. Another plant very conspicuously ornamental
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
to these barren deserts, is a lactescent annual,
belonging to the family of the convolvulac&aelig;, with a bright
purple corolla, as large as that of the common stramonium.
We also observed the white-stalked primrose, (œnothera
albicaulis, N.) a very small white-flowered species of
talinum, and some others. We observed, in repeated
instances, several individuals of a singular genus of reptiles
(chirotes, Cuv.) which in form resemble short serpents,
but are more closely allied to the lizards, by being furnished
with two feet. They were so active, that it was
not without some difficulty that we succeeded in obtaining
a specimen. Of this (as was our uniform custom, when
any apparently new animal was presented) we immediately
drew out a description. But as the specimen was
unfortunately lost, and the description formed part of
the zoological notes and observations, which were carried
off by our deserters, we are reduced to the necessity of
merely indicating the probability of the existence of the
chirotes lumbricoides of naturalists, within the territory
of the United States.</p>

<p>At night we were again alarmed by a disturbance
among our horses, of which we were not able to ascertain
the cause. Some of the party had, on the preceding day,
reported that they had seen Indians at a distance, that
they were on horseback, &amp;c. but of this there could be
no certainty, the imagination often representing a herd of
antelopes, or other animals, seen at a distance, and perhaps
distorted by the looming of the prairie, as so many
mounted Indians. We had often found ourselves more
grossly abused by our eye-sight, than is supposed in this
instance, having mistaken turkies for bisons, wolves for
horses, &amp;c.</p>

<p>28th. We breakfasted, and left our encampment {171}
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
before five o'clock. We had not proceeded far when we
discovered about thirty wild horses at a distance before
us. They had taken our scent, and run off in a fright,
when we were a mile distant. Their activity and fleetness
surpassed what we had expected from this noble
animal in his savage state. In the course of the day we
saw other herds, but all at a distance. The country
south of the Platte contains, as we are informed, vast
numbers of horses. They are of the domesticated stock
introduced by the Spaniards, but they multiply rapidly
in their present state of regained freedom, and are apparently
wilder than any of the native occupants of this
country. They are of various colours, and of all sizes,
there being many colts, and some mules, among them.
Their playfulness, rather than their fears, seemed to be
excited by our appearance, and we often saw them, more
than a mile distant, leaping and curvetting, involved by a
cloud of dust, which they seemed to delight in raising.</p>

<p>About some sandy ridges, which we passed in the
middle of the day, several miliary rattle-snakes were
seen, two of which were killed. These had been occasionally
met with all along the Platte, but were by no means
numerous. Mr. Peale killed a female antelope, without
leaving our line. The animal had not been able to
satisfy its curiosity, and stood at a little distance gazing
at us, until it was shot down.</p>

<p>During the day we passed three small creeks discharging
into the Platte from the north-west. One of these, called
by the Indians Bat-so-ah, or Cherry creek, heads in the
Rocky Mountains.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> On these creeks are a few small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
cotton-wood and willow trees. These trees, as well as
all those along the Platte, are low, with very large and
branching tops, as is the case with all trees which grow
remote from each other.</p>

<p>In the afternoon hunters were sent forward, but it was
not without some difficulty that a single bison {172} was
killed, those animals having become much less frequent.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

<p>Our small stock of bread was by this time so nearly
exhausted, that it was thought prudent to reserve the
remainder as a last resort, in case of the failure of a supply
of game, or other accident. A quantity of parched maize,
equal to a gill per day, to each man, was daily distributed
to each of the three messes into which the party was
divided. This was thrown into the kettle where the
bison meat was boiled, and supplied the place of barley
in the soup, always the first and most important dish.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
Whenever game was plenty we had a variety of excellent
dishes, consisting of the choice parts of the bison, the
tongue, the hump ribs, the marrow-bones, &amp;c. dressed
in various ways. The hump ribs of the bison, which
many epicures prefer to any other part of the animal, are
the spinous processes of the backbone, and are from
eighteen to twenty-four inches in length. They are
taken out with a small portion of the flesh adhering to
each side, and whether roasted, boiled, or stewed, are
certainly very far superior to any part of the flesh of the
domestic ox.</p>

<p>29th. We had proceeded but a few miles from our
camp when it was found that Mr. Say's horse was so far
exhausted as to be unable to proceed at the same pace as
the other horses. Mr. Say accordingly dismounted, and
by driving his horse before him, urged the animal along
for a few miles; but this being found too laborious, and as
several of the horses were near failing, it was determined
to halt, which we did at ten o'clock, and remained in camp
during the day.</p>

<p>The country, for several miles to the west of the range
of hills mentioned above, is as uniformly plain as that on
any part of the Platte. It differs from that further to the
east only in being of a coarser sand, and in an aspect of
more unvaried sterility. The cactus ferox reigns sole
monarch, and sole possessor {173} of thousands of acres
of this dreary plain. It forms patches which neither a
horse nor any other animal will attempt to pass over.
The rabbit's foot plantation, and a few brown and withered
grasses, are sparingly scattered over the intervening spaces.
In depressed and moist situations, where the soil is not
so entirely unproductive, the variegated spurge (euphorbia
variegata), with its painted involucrum and party-coloured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
leaves, is a conspicuous and beautiful ornament. The
lepidium virginicum, distributed over every part of northern
and equinoctial America, from Hudson's Bay to the
summit of the Silla of Caraccas,<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> is here of such diminutive
size that we were induced to search, though we sought
in vain, for some character to distinguish it as a separate
species.</p>

<p>At three o'clock <small>P. M.</small> the planet Venus was distinctly
visible. Its distance from the sun at 3h. 45m. was east
36&deg; 15[']. There were a few broken cumulostratose clouds
from the south-west, otherwise the sky was clear, and near
the zenith, where the star was seen, of a deep and beautiful
azure. Our actual elevation, at this time, must have been
considerable, and might be supposed to effect, in some
degree, the transparency of our atmosphere.</p>

<p>Several magpies were seen about the islands in the river,
where it is probable they rear their young.</p>

<p>On the 30th we left the encampment at our accustomed
early hour, and at eight o'clock were cheered by a distant
view of the Rocky Mountains. For some time we were
unable to decide whether what we saw were mountains, or
banks of cumulous clouds skirting the horizon, and glittering
in the reflected rays of the sun. It was only by
watching the bright parts, and observing that their form
and position remained unaltered, that we were able to
satisfy ourselves they were indeed mountains. They were
visible from the lowest parts of the plain, and {174} their
summits were, when first discovered, several degrees above
our horizon. They became visible by detaching themselves
from the sky beyond, and not by emerging from
beneath the sensible horizon, so that we might have seen
them from a greater distance had it not been for the want
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
of transparency in the atmosphere. Our first views of
the mountains were indistinct, on account of some smokiness
of the atmosphere, but from our encampment, at noon,
we had a very distinct and satisfactory prospect of them.
A small part only of the intervening plain was visible, the
convexity of the surface intercepting the view from the base
of the mountains, and that portion of the plain adjacent
to it.</p>

<p>Snow could be seen on every part of them which was
visible above our horizon.</p>

<p>The thermometer immersed in the water of the river
fell from 80&deg;, the temperature of the atmosphere, to 75&deg;.
Observations had been made daily to ascertain the temperature
of the water of the Platte.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> Notwithstanding
there were only about five degrees of difference between
the temperature of the air and that of the water, it was remarked
by several of the party, that a sensation of extreme
cold was felt on passing from the one to the other.</p>

<p>It is possible, that at the elevation we had now attained,
the rapidity of evaporation, on account of the diminished
pressure of the atmosphere, might be something greater
than we had been accustomed to. For several days the sky
had been clear, and in the morning we had observed an unusual
degree of transparency in every part of the atmosphere.
As the day advanced, and the heat of the sun began
to be felt, such quantities of vapour were seen to ascend from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
every part of the plain, that all objects, at a little distance,
appeared magnified, and variously distorted. An undulating
or tremulous motion in ascending lines was manifest
over every part of the {175} surface. Commencing soon
after sunrise it continued to increase in quantity until the
afternoon, when it diminished gradually, keeping an even
pace with the intensity of the sun's heat. The density of
the vapour was often such as to produce the perfect image
of a pool of water in every valley upon which we could
look down at an angle of about ten degrees. This
effect was several times seen so perfect and beautiful as
to deceive almost every one of our party. A herd of
bisons, at the distance of a mile, seemed to be standing in
a pool of water; and what appeared to us the reflected
image was as distinctly seen as the animal itself. Illusions
of this kind are common in the African and Asiatic deserts,
as we learn from travellers, and from the language of poets.
They are called by the Persians <i>sirraub</i>, "water of the
desert;" and in the Sanscrit language, <i>Mriga trichna</i>, "the
desire or thirst of the antelope." Elphinstone relates,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a>
that at Moujgur, in the kingdom of Caubul, towards evening
many persons were astonished at the appearance of a
long lake enclosing several little islands. Notwithstanding
the well known nature of the country, which was a
sandy desert, many were positive that it was a lake, and
one of the surveyors took the bearings of it. "I had imagined,"
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
says he, "this phenomenon to be occasioned by
a thin vapour which is spread over the ground in hot
weather in India, but this appearance was entirely different,
and on looking along the ground no vapour whatever
could be perceived. The ground was quite level and
smooth, and the weather very hot. It is only found in
level, smooth, and dry places; the position of the sun, and
the degree of heat, are not material, for it was afterwards
seen in Damaun, when the weather was not hotter than in
England." On the frontier of Caubul, Elphinstone saw
what he calls a most magnificent mirage, {176} which looked
like an extensive lake, or a very wide river. The water
seemed clear and beautiful, and the figures of two gentlemen,
who rode along it, were <i>reflected as distinctly as in
real water</i>. "It is common in our own country," says the
London Monthly Review, "for ground-mists to assume
the appearance of water, to make a meadow seem inundated,
and to change a valley into a lake; but these mists
never reflect the surrounding trees and hills. Hence, the
<i>mirage</i> must consist of a peculiar gas, of which the particles
are combined by a stronger attraction of cohesion than the
vapours of real water; the <i>liquor silicum</i> of the alchymists
is described as exhibiting, in some circumstances, this
glassy surface, yet as being equally evanescent."<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> It is
afterwards suggested, in the same paper, that the gas
which occasioned these extraordinary reflections, may probably
be the substance of the pernicious wind called Simoom.
The explanation here offered will not probably
be thought satisfactory. It seems to belong to the epoch
of great and brilliant discoveries in pneumatic chymistry,
when "a peculiar gas" was thought the agent of every
phenomenon.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<p>The images of pools of water, which we saw in the
deserts of the Platte, appeared to us similar to those mentioned
by Elphinstone, likewise to those observed by
Nieburgh<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> in Arabia, where inverted images were seen.</p>

<p>To the more common effects of light passing through a
medium charged with vapours, we had become familiar.
We had, for many days, seen the low bluffs of the valley
of the Platte suspended over the verge of our apparent
horizon, as distant capes are suspended over the sea; but
in viewing these perfect images of lakes, we could scarce
believe they were occasioned by <i>refraction</i>, to which the
phenomena of mirage have usually been attributed.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>
{177} The circumstance that these pools could only be seen
when we looked down at a considerable angle upon some
valley; the perfect manner in which the image of the sky
was returned from the surface, and the inverted position
of the objects seen, induced us to inquire whether the
effect might not be produced by reflection from the lower
stratum of watery vapour.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> These appearances are sufficient
to justify the conclusion that the quantity of evaporation is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
much greater here than in less elevated districts of
country, where such things are not seen.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_269" src="images/i_269.jpg"
alt="" />
<p class="caption">Distant View of the Rocky Mountains</p>
</div>

<p>Towards evening the air became more clear, and our
view of the mountains was more satisfactory, though as
yet we could only distinguish their grand outline, imprinted
in bold indentations upon the luminous margin
of the sky. We soon remarked a particular part of the
range divided into three conic summits, each apparently
of nearly equal altitude. This we concluded to be the point
designated by Pike as the highest peak. Its bearing was
taken a short time before we halted for the evening, and
found to be south, 73&deg; west.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> As we were about to encamp,
some of the party went in pursuit of a herd of bisons,
one of which they killed, and returned to camp a little
before sunset.</p>

<p>July 1st. Although the temperature indicated by the
thermometer for several days had been about 80&deg;, in the
middle of the day, the heat, owing to the cool breezes from
the mountain, had been by no means oppressive. On the
night of the 30th of June, the mercury fell to 55&deg;, and on
the following morning the air was chilly, and a strong breeze
was felt before sunrise, from the south-east. We left our
camp at a very early hour, and travelled over a tract differing
in no respect but its greater barrenness from that
passed on the preceding day. We halted to dine at the
distance of sixteen and a half miles. Many acres of this
plain had not vegetation enough to communicate {178} to
the surface the least shade of green; a few dwarfish sunflowers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
and grasses, which had grown here in the early
part of the summer, being now entirely withered and
brown. In stagnant pools near the river, we saw the
common arrow head, (sagittaria sagittifolia,) the alisma
plantago, and the small lemna growing together, as in
similar situations in the eastern states.</p>

<p>A striking feature of that part of the plain country, we
were now passing, is formed by innumerable ant-heaps,
rising from twelve to eighteen inches above the common
level of the surface. They occur with some uniformity,
at intervals of about twenty feet, and are all similar in size
and dimensions. They consist so entirely of small grains
of flesh-coloured felspar, that they have, all of them, an
uniform reddish aspect, and it is not without careful examination,
that any other kind of gravel can be detected
in them. The entrance to the interior of each of these
little mounds is uniformly on the eastward side, and very
rarely occurs beyond the boundaries of N. E. and S. E.
It is never at the top, nor on a level with the surface of the
soil, but is a little elevated above it. It seems highly probable,
that the active little architects thus place the entrance
of their edifice on the eastward side, in order to
escape the direct influence of the cold mountain winds.</p>

<p>At three o'clock, as we were about to resume our journey,
there came on a gentle shower of rain, with wind at east, and
low broken clouds. In the afternoon we passed some small
ridges of sandstone crossing the river from north to south,
but very inconsiderable in point of elevation and extent.
We travelled this day twenty-seven miles, directly towards
the base of the mountains, but they appeared almost as
distant in the evening as they had done in the morning.
The bearing of the high peak above mentioned, from our
encampment, was south, 75&deg; west.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

<p>{179} The ensuing day being Sabbath, was devoted to
rest. About our camp, which was in the most fertile spot
we could select, in a ride of several miles, there was but
a very insufficient supply of grass for our horses. A
species of cone flower, (rudbeckia columnaris, N.) was
here beginning to expand. The showy R. purpurea, very
common on the Missouri, and the lower part of the Platte,
does not extend into the desolate regions. The common
purslane (portulacca oleracea) is one of the most frequent
plants about the base of the Rocky Mountains, particularly
in places much frequented as licks by the bisons and
other animals.</p>

<p>From this encampment, we had a plain but still distant
view of the mountains. No inequality occurs in the surface
of the subjacent country on the east of the mountains,
so that our view was wholly unobstructed. They
stretched from north to south like an immense wall, occupying
all that portion of the horizon lying to the north-west,
west, and south-west. We could now see the
surface of the plain, extending almost unvaried to the
base of the first ridge, which rises by an abrupt ascent
above the commencement of the snow.</p>

<p>A set of observations for longitude was commenced in
the morning, but the weather becoming cloudy, we were
prevented from completing them. In the afternoon a
storm came on from the north, which continued during
the night. Much rain fell, accompanied with thunder
and high but variable winds. Between twelve o'clock
and sunset, the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer fell
nineteen degrees, from 89&deg; to 60&deg;.</p>

<p>3d. Breakfast was despatched, and we had mounted
our horses before five o'clock. We were enabled to have
our breakfast thus early, as the sentinel on duty during the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
night, was directed to put the kettles over the fire at three
o'clock, all the processes preparatory {180} to boiling having
been finished on the preceding evening.</p>

<p>As we approached the mountains, wood became much
more abundant along the Platte. We had often heard
our guide, in speaking of the country, two or three days'
journey from the mountains, mention the Grand Forest,
and were a little surprised on arriving at it, to find no more
than a narrow but uninterrupted stripe of timber, extending
along the immediate banks of the river, never occupying
the space of half a mile in width.</p>

<p>For several days the direction of our course in ascending
the Platte, had inclined considerably to the south, varying
from due west to south, 20&deg; west.</p>

<p>In the course of the day, we passed the mouths of three
large creeks, heading in the mountains, and entering the
Platte from the north-west. One of these, nearly opposite
to which we encamped, is called Potera's creek, from a
Frenchman of that name, who is said to have been bewildered
upon it, wandering about for twenty days, almost
without food. He was then found by a band of Kiawas,
who frequent this part of the country, and restored to his
companions, a party of hunters, at that time encamped on
the Arkansa.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

<p>Throughout the day we were approaching the mountains
obliquely, and from our encampment at evening, we
supposed them to be about twenty miles distant. Clouds
were hanging about all the higher parts of the mountains,
which were sometimes observed to collect together, and
descend in showers, circumscribed to a limited district.
This state of the weather obstructed the clearness, but
added greatly to the imposing grandeur of some of the
views which the mountain presented.</p>

<p>4th. We had hoped to celebrate our great national
festival on the Rocky Mountains; but the day had arrived,
and they were still at a distance. Being extremely impatient
of any unnecessary delay, which {181} prevented
us from entering upon the examination of the mountains,
we did not devote the day to rest, as had been our intention.
We did not, however, forget to celebrate the anniversary
of our national independence, according to our circumstances.
An extra pint of maize was issued to each mess,
and a small portion of whiskey distributed.</p>

<p>On leaving the camp in the morning, Major Long and
Lieutenant Swift preceded the party, intending to select
a suitable place for encampment, where they proposed
to commence a set of observations, and to wait the arrival
of the remainder of the party. But as they had gone forward
about two miles, the point of woods at which they
had left the course was mistaken by the main body, which
moved on until about eleven o'clock. By this time much
anxiety was felt on account of their absence, and persons
were sent out to attempt to discover them, but returned unsuccessful.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
A circumstance tending to increase the anxiety
which was felt, was, that Indians were reported to have
been seen in the course of the morning by several of the
party. Captain Bell was about to despatch as large a force
as it was thought prudent to spare from the camp, to
search for them in all the distance which had been passed
since they were seen, when they arrived at the encampment
of the main body, at half past one <small>P.M.</small></p>

<p>The observations which had been made were, of course,
lost, as the corresponding equal altitudes for the correction
of time could not be had.</p>

<p>In the evening, the meridional altitude of Antares was
taken for latitude.</p>

<p>Several valuable plants were here collected, and, among
others, a large suffruticose species of lupine. The long-leaved
cotton-wood<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> of Lewis and Clarke, which is,
according to their suggestion, a species of populus, is here
of very common occurrence. It is {182} found intermixed
with the common cotton-wood, resembling it in size and
general aspect. Its leaves are long and narrow; its trunk
smoother, and its branches more slender and flexile than
those of the populus angulata. Some of its fruit was fortunately
still remaining, affording us an opportunity to be
entirely satisfied of its relation to this genus.</p>

<p>Here we also observed both species of the splendid and
interesting Bartonia, and B. nuda in full flower, the ornata
not yet expanded.</p>

<p>These most singular plants are interesting on several
accounts, particularly the regular expansion of their large
and beautiful flowers towards the evening of several successive
days. In the morning the long and slender petals,
and the petal-like nectaries, which compose the flower,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
are found accurately closed upon each other, forming a
cone of about an inch in length. In this situation they
remain, if the weather be clear, until about sunset, when
they gradually expand. If the weather be dark and cloudy,
with a humid atmosphere, they are awakened from their
slumbers at an earlier hour. We have, in some instances,
seen them fully expanded early in the afternoon; but this
has always been in stormy or cloudy weather. In this
particular the Bartonia bears some resemblance to the
great night-flowering cereus, to which it is closely allied;
but the gaudy petals of the cereus, once unfolded, fall into
a state of irretrievable collapse, whereas, the Bartonia
closes and expands its flowers for many days in succession.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p>A number of young magpies were seen in the bushes
about the river; also the nests and young of the mockingbird,
(turdus orpheus, Vieil.)</p>

<p>The prairie-dog villages we had observed to become
more frequent and more extensive as we approached the
mountains; and we had now constant opportunities of contrasting
the stupendous elevations of the Andes with the
humble mounds cast up by this interesting little animal.
We observed in the {183} numerous burrows an appearance
of greater antiquity than in those more remote from the
mountains. Many of the mounds occupy an extent of
several yards in diameter, though of but inconsiderable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
elevation, and with the exception of the present entrance,
overgrown with a scanty herbage, which always marks the
area of the prairie-dog villages. Indeed we have observed
several large villages, with scarce a trace of
vegetation about them. The food of the marmot consisting
of grasses and herbaceous plants, it is not perhaps
easy to assign a reason for the preference which, in selecting
the site of his habitation, he always shows for the most
barren places, unless it be that he may enjoy an unobstructed
view of the surrounding country, in order to be
seasonably warned of the approach of wolves, or other
enemies.</p>

<p>Rattle-snakes of a particular species<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> are sometimes
seen in these villages. They are found between the Mississippi
and the Rocky Mountains, and appear to prefer
an unproductive soil, where their sluggish gait may not
be retarded by the opposing obstacles of grass and weeds.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
Whilst exploring Bowyer creek of the Missouri, in the
spring of 1820, our party met with six or eight of them
during one day's march on the prairie; and on our subsequent
journey to the Rocky Mountains, we several times
encountered equal, or even greater numbers, in the same
space of time. This is the species of serpent which travellers
have observed to frequent the villages of the prairie
dogs, and to which they have attributed the unnatural
habit of voluntary domiciliation with that interesting animal.
It is true that the tergeminus, like many other serpents,
will secure a refuge from danger in any hole of the
earth, rock, or fallen tree that may present itself, regardless
of the rightful occupant; but we witnessed no facts which
could be received as a proof that it was an acceptable inmate
of the dwelling of the arctomys.</p>

<p>{184} From the disparity in the number of plates and
scales, and from the greater size of the vertebral spots
in this species than in the C. miliaris, we have been induced
to consider this as a distinct species. Specimens are in
the Philadelphia museum.</p>

<p>On the 5th of July we left our camp at an early hour, and
ascended the Platte about ten miles. Here the party encamped
for the day;<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> and Mr. Peale and Dr. James, with
two riflemen, went out for an excursion on foot, intending
to ascend the Cannon-ball creek to the mountains, which
appeared to be about five miles distant.</p>

<p>This creek is rapid and clear, flowing over a bed paved
with rounded masses of granite and gneiss. It is from a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
supposed resemblance of these masses to cannon balls that
the creek has received its name from the French hunters.
The channel is sunk from fifty to one hundred feet below
the common level of the plain.</p>

<p>This plain consists of a bed of coarse pebbles, gravel,
and sand; and its surface is thinly covered with prickly
pears, and a scanty growth of starved and rigid grasses.
Among these the hygrometric stipa, (s. juncea, s. barbata,)
is extremely troublesome, its barbed and pointed seeds
adhering and penetrating, like the quills of the porcupine,
into every part of the dress with which they come in contact.
The long and rigid awn is contorted or straight, in
proportion to the humidity or dryness of the atmosphere;
indicating the changes in this respect with the precision
of the nicest hygrometer.</p>

<p>The detached party extended their walk about eight
miles without finding that they had very considerably
diminished the apparent distance to the base of the mountain.
They had unluckily forgotten to make any provision
for dinner, and now found themselves fatigued and hungry
at the distance of eight miles from the encampment of the
main body and so far from the mountains, that it was
evidently {185} impossible they should reach them and
return on the same day. It was therefore determined to
relinquish the attempt, and Mr. Peale was fortunate
enough to kill a couple of curlews, which were roasted
and eaten without loss of time.</p>

<p>Near the place of this halt they observed some small
sandstone ridges similar to those on the Platte below, and
collected, among other plants, the species of currant (ribes
aureum?) so often mentioned by Lewis and Clarke, the
fruit of which formed an important article of the subsistence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
of their party while crossing the Rocky Mountains.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>They also saw about the shelvings of the sandstone
rocks, which formed for some distance the banks of the
stream, innumerable nests of the cliff swallows, similar to
those seen on the Missouri. In returning to the camp by
a different route, they were much annoyed by the prickly
pears, covering the ground so closely, that their feet were
frequently wounded by the thorns, against which their
mockasins presented but a very inadequate protection.</p>

<p>Having killed a young antelope, they recrossed the
Platte, which was here about three feet deep, and clear,
and rapid, and arrived at camp at sun-set.</p>

<p>Here a complete set of observations, for latitude, longitude,
&amp;c., had been taken. Major Long and Lieutenant
Swift having preceded the party in the morning, and arrived
before seven o'clock for that purpose. In the evening,
observations were attempted, but without success,
as the sky soon became cloudy.</p>

<p>Robins, which we had not seen since we left the Missouri,
here occurred in considerable numbers.</p>

<p>On the following morning, soon after leaving the encampment,
we crossed Vermilion creek, a considerable
tributary from the south. Its upper branches interlock
with those of a tributary of the Arkansa. In some part
of its course, its valley is bounded by {186} precipitous cliffs
of a red sand-rock, whence the name of the creek.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>

<p>Our guide informed us that the Indians, a few years
since, destroyed every individual of a large herd of bisons,
by driving them over the brink of one of these precipices.</p>

<p>Opposite the mouth of Vermilion creek is a much larger
stream, from the north-west, which is called medicine-lodge
creek,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> from an old Indian medicine lodge, which
formerly stood near its mouth. A few miles further, on
the same side, is Grand Camp creek, heading also in the
mountains. About four years previous to the time of our
visit, there had been a large encampment of Indians and
hunters on this creek. On that occasion, three nations
of Indians, namely, the Kiawas, Arrapahoes, and Kaskaias
or Bad-hearts, had been assembled together, with
forty-five French hunters in the employ of Mr. Choteau
and Mr. Demun of St. Louis.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> They had assembled
for the purpose of holding a trading council with a band
of Shiennes. These last had been recently supplied with
goods by the British traders on the Missouri, and had come
to exchange them with the former for horses. The Kiawas,
Arrapahoes, &amp;c. who wander in the fertile plains of
the Arkansa and Red river, have always great numbers
of horses, which they rear with much less difficulty than the
Shiennes, whose country is cold and barren.</p>

<p class="caption">View of the Chasm through which the Platte issues from the Rocky Mountains</p>

<p>The British traders annually supply the Minnetarees
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
or Gros-ventres of the Missouri with goods; from these
they pass to the Shiennes and Crow Indians, who, in their
turn, barter them with remoter tribes: in this manner the
Indians who wander near the mountains receive their supplies
of goods, and they give a decided and well founded
preference to those which reach them by this circuitous
channel, to those which they receive from any other source.</p>

<p>Two miles beyond Grand Camp creek, is the mouth
of Grape creek, and a little above, on the {187} opposite
side, that of Defile creek,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> a tributary to the Platte, from
the south, which has its course in a narrow defile, lying
along the base of the mountains.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock we arrived at the boundary of that vast
plain, across which we had held our weary march for a
distance of near one thousand miles, and encamped at the
base of the mountain. The woodless plain is terminated
by a range of naked and almost perpendicular rocks, visible
at a distance of several miles, and resembling a vast wall,
parallel to the base of the mountain. These rocks are
sandstone similar in composition and character to that on
the Cannon-ball creek. They emerge at a great angle of
inclination from beneath the alluvial of the plain, and rise
abruptly to an elevation of one hundred and fifty or two
hundred feet. Passing within this first range, we found
a narrow valley separating it from a second ridge of sandstone,
of nearly equal elevation, and apparently resting
against the base of a high primitive hill beyond. At the
foot of the first range, the party encamped at noon, and
were soon scattered in various directions, being eager to
commence the examination of that interesting region.</p>

<p>Our camp was immediately in front of the chasm,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
through which the Platte issues from the mountains. A
little to the south is a commanding eminence, from which
the view of the chasm was taken.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX_VII">{188} CHAPTER IX {VII}</h2>

<p class="hang">Sandstone Formation at the Base of the Rocky Mountains—The
Platte within the Mountains—Granitic Mountains
Between the Platte and Arkansa—Castle Rock—Birds—Plants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> district occupied by the inclined sandstone, at the
base of the mountains, we found much wider, and the
rocky summits incomparably more elevated, than from a
remote view we had supposed.</p>

<p>July 6. This extensive range, rising abruptly from the
plain, skirts the base of the mountains like an immense
rampart, and to a spectator placed near it, intercepts the
view of the still more grand and imposing features of the
granitic ridge beyond. It is made up of rocks composed
of the broken down and comminuted fragments of preexisting
aggregates embosoming reliqu&aelig; of the animals
of a former world, known to us only by the monuments
which these remains exhibit. Though rugged and precipitous,
its elevation is small, when compared to that of the
stupendous Andes, which rise above it far into the regions
of perpetual winter. The stratifications with which it is
distinctly seamed, penetrate the mass with various degrees
of obliquity, sometimes running perpendicularly to the
horizon; seeming unequivocally to prove, that the whole
has receded from its original position, and that these immense
rocky masses have, by the operation of some powerful
agent, been broken off from their original continuity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
with the strata now found in a horizontal position in the
plains.</p>

<p>It is difficult, when contemplating the present appearance
and situation of these rocks, to prevent the {189} imagination
from wandering back to that remote period, when
the billows of an ocean lashed the base of the Andes, depositing,
during a succession of ages, that vast accumulation
of rounded fragments of rocks, alternating with beds
of animal remains, which now extends without interruption
from the base of this range to the summits of the Alleghany
mountains; and endeavouring to form some idea
of that great subsequent catastrophe, by which this secondary
formation has so changed its elevation, in relation
to the primitive, that its margin has been broken off and
thrown into an inclined or vertical position.</p>

<p>The valley which intervenes between this huge parapet
of sand-rock and the first range of the primitive is nearly
a mile in width; it is ornamented with numerous insulated
columnar rocks, sometimes of a snowy whiteness, standing
like pyramids and obelisks, interspersed among mounds
and hillocks, which seem to have resulted from the disintegration
of similar masses. This range of sandstone
would appear to have been originally of uniform elevation
and uninterrupted continuity, running along the base of
the mountains from north to south; but it has been cut
through by the bed of the Platte, and all the larger streams
in their descent to the plains.</p>

<p>From our camp, we had expected to be able to ascend
the most distant summits then in sight, and return the
same evening; but night overtook us, and we found ourselves
scarcely arrived at the base of the mountain.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
The lower part of the sandstone stratum, being exposed
at the western declivities of the hills, and in the parts
nearest the granite, contains extensive beds of coarse conglomeratic,
or pudding-stone, often of a reddish colour.
The more compact parts of the rock contain the remains
of terebratul&aelig;, and other submarine animals. Among
these, few are entire or in good preservation. We observed
here several singular scorpion-like, spider-formed {190}
animals, inhabiting under stones and dried bisons' dung.
They have a formidable appearance, and run actively.
They belong to the class arachnoides, genus galeodes,
which has been heretofore observed only in warm climates;
not one was known to inhabit this continent.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<p>About the sandstone ledges we collected a geranium<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>
intermediate between the crane's-bill and herb-robert,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
the beautiful calochortus (C. elegans, Ph.) and a few other
valuable plants.</p>

<p>The Platte, at the foot of the mountains, is twenty-five
yards wide, having an average depth of about three feet,
its water clear and cool, and its current rapid. Its descent
for twenty miles below cannot be less than ten feet per
mile. Its valley is narrow and serpentine, bounded by
steep and elevated hills, embosoming innumerable little
lawns, often of a semicircular form, ornamented by the
narrow margin of shrubbery along the Platte.</p>

<p>The narrow valley between the ridges of sandstone is
a little more fertile than the plains along the river. It is
covered with fine and short grasses, and is varied with here
and there a copse of small oaks or hazels. There are also
some columnar masses of white sandstone, twenty or
thirty feet high, standing remote from each other, having
the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> around their bases covered with shrubby oaks.
As we were passing near one of these, an uncommonly large
and beautiful buck deer sprung out from the bushes, and
stood gazing on us, until he received in his side the ball,
which brought him instantly to the earth.</p>

<p>We observed here the obscure wren,<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> a bird more
closely related to the great Carolina wren of Wilson than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
any other we have seen; but the characters drawn from
the primaries, and from the marking of the tail, sufficiently
distinguish it from that species. The bill is somewhat
longer, and the general tint of the plumage of a much more
sombre hue. It frequents the arid country in this vicinity,
{191} and is often seen hopping about upon the branches,
and singular compressed semi-procumbent trunks of the
juniperus depressa. The bill of this species approaches
the form which characterizes the genus certhia, in which
Wilson has placed its kindred species, the Carolina wren.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 7th of July, the party remaining
in the encampment of the preceding day, Dr. James and
Mr. Peale, accompanied by two riflemen, were sent out
to examine the mountains. These appeared most accessible
on the north side of the river, opposite our encampment.
The river was here about four feet deep, and the
strength of the current such as to render it impossible for
a man to keep his feet in the deepest part of the stream.
As some of the party destined for the mountains could not
swim, it was thought hazardous for them to attempt to
cross the river by fording. To obviate this difficulty, two
men were sent with a long rope, which they were directed
to stretch across the river, making the ends fast on either
shore. This was readily accomplished, one of the men
swimming across with an end of the rope in his teeth. By
the aid of this, the detachment were enabled to keep their
feet in crossing, though with extreme difficulty, as the bed
of the river was uneven and rocky. They all, however,
arrived in safety on the left-hand bank by about sunrise.</p>

<p>After passing the region of inclined sandstone, which
is about two miles in width, they began to rise upon what
may be considered the base of the mountain. As the day
advanced, the heat became oppressive, and they found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
themselves somewhat exhausted before they had crossed
the sandstone hills, which appeared so inconsiderable from
our encampment, that the labour of crossing them had been
almost forgotten in estimating the toils of the day. The
first range of primitive rocks they found far more abrupt
and rugged than what they had already passed. Its sides
are destitute of vegetation, except a few prickly {192} pears
and yuccas, with here and there a stinted oak or juniper,
and so steep that great exertion as well as the utmost caution,
are necessary in ascending.</p>

<p>The rock is an aggregate of felspar and hornblende,
approaching in character some of the common varieties
of sienite. On the eastern side, where the felspar is in the
greatest proportion, it is flesh-coloured, and its structure
crystalline; the fractured surface of the mass being uneven
like that of coarse granite. Advancing towards the west,
hornblende was found to become more and more predominant,
and so arranged as to have in the mass a laminated
appearance. The natural fissures or cleavages between
the lamina run nearly in a perpendicular direction, giving
the rock the columnar structure of trap or greenstone.</p>

<p>As the detachment proceeded, a few interesting insects
and plants occurred to reward their labours. But these
impenetrable and naked rocks, are the abodes of few living
beings, either animal or vegetable. In the crevices of the
rocks where a scanty soil has accumulated, is here and
there planted a hardy evergreen, whose short and gnarled
trunk, recurved and inflexible branches, proclaim the
storms it has withstood, and the centuries during which
it has vegetated.</p>

<p>The design of the party had been to cross the first range
of the mountains and gain the valley of the Platte beyond,
but this they found themselves unable to accomplish.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
After climbing successively to the summit of several
ridges which they had supposed to be the top of the mountain,
they still found others beyond higher and more rugged.
They therefore relinquished the intention of crossing,
and began to look for the best way to descend to the
bed of the river, which lay on their left hand. Here they
halted to rest for a few moments, and exposed a thermometer
in the shade of a large rock. The mercury fell to 72&deg;;
in camp, at the same hour it stood at {193} 86&deg;. They
were so much elevated above the river, that although they
could see it plainly, it appeared like a small brook of two
or three yards in width, and though white with foam and
spray, caused by the impetuosity of its current, and the
roughness of its channel, its "idle chiding could not be
heard so high." They could distinguish two principal
branches of the Platte—one coming from the north-west,
the other from the south; a little below the confluence of
these branches, the river turns abruptly to the S. E.,
bursting through a chasm in a vast mural precipice of
naked columnar rocks.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<p>About noon the detachment commenced their descent,
which cost them no less exertion than their ascent in the
morning. Their fatigue was aggravated by thirst, as they
met with no water, nor any shade excepting that of projecting
rocks in the higher parts of the mountain.</p>

<p>They chose a different route from that which they had
taken in ascending, intending to descend to the river, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
the hope of being able to travel along its bed. They were
obliged to assist each other in lowering themselves down
precipices; they would have found it impossible to pass
singly. On the southern declivity of the mountain, they
met with a few ripe currants, but these were hard and
juiceless, of a sweetish taste, and aggravated, instead of
alleviating their thirst, and were probably the cause of a
violent head-ache, with which several of the party were
affected soon after eating them. There were also found
a few large and delicious raspberries, of a species approaching
the flowering raspberry (rubus odoratus), but with
smaller leaves, and a more branching stem.</p>

<p>After descending from the more precipitous parts about
the summit of the mountain, they crossed along a rugged
tract, buried and rendered almost impassable by boulders
and fragments which had fallen from above, and were at
length so fortunate as to {194} find a spring of cool water,
and a shade, in a narrow ravine; where they sat down to
rest and dine on the provision they had brought.</p>

<p>The men who were with them stopped in the same ravine,
a few rods below. One of these was violently
attacked, immediately after drinking of the water, with
headache, vomiting, and purging, which increased to such
an alarming degree, that he was presently unable to stand
upon his feet. As it was feared he would not soon be able
to walk, Mr. Peale undertook to return alone to camp, and
give notice of his situation, and return with medicine and
assistance.</p>

<p>He descended along a rough and obstructed ravine,
until he arrived at the Platte, but found the valley so confined
as to be impassable, and again directed his course
towards the north-east, attempting to regain the route
which the party had taken in ascending. After a most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
rugged and fatiguing march of about six miles, he arrived
at camp late in the afternoon. Here he found a number
of the party suffering in a similar manner, but not so
severely as the man he had left in the mountains. Two
men were immediately despatched in search of the disabled
party.</p>

<p>Mr. Peale had left them but a short time, when their
attention was called to the noise as of some large animal
running up the narrow defile in which they were sitting;
on turning round they perceived a large bear advancing
at full speed towards the place where they were. Seizing
their rifles, they fired upon him at the distance of about
ten steps, but the bear, without stopping or turning his
head, mounted an almost perpendicular precipice of about
thirty feet, and was out of sight in an instant.</p>

<p>At this spot, which was several miles within the mountains,
and elevated nearly to the limit of ph&aelig;nogamous
vegetation, the common hop (H. lupulus) was growing in
perfection; also the box elder (acer negundo, Ph.), the
common sarsaparilla of the eastern {195} States (aralia
nudicaulis), the spikenard (A. vacemora), and many other
common plants.</p>

<p>After waiting about two hours, they found the sick man
so far recovered as to be able to stand upon his feet and
walk a little. They therefore relieved him of his gun and
other luggage, and moved by short stages towards camp,
where they arrived at a late hour in the evening.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>

<p>The men who had been sent out to their assistance returned
some time afterwards, having sought for them without
success.</p>

<p>On the morning,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> soon after the departure of Dr.
James's detachment, two of the party passed into the mountains
on the left side of the river; they experienced much
difficulty, and underwent much labour in scaling the steep
ascents, and some hazard in descending the precipitous
declivities which marked their course. The timber was
small, scrubby, and scattered in the most favoured situation;
and many of the solitary pines which occupied an
elevated position, had evidently been the sport of furious
tempests, being rived and seamed by lightning. Upon
surmounting one of the elevations, they observed on a
projecting ledge of the succeeding mountain two elk grazing,
which seemed to be at a very short distance; and in
consequence of this deceptive appearance were magnified
into a vast size. The party were surprized at the apparent
heedlessness of these animals, which remained peacefully
feeding, whilst the party was clambering along the
rocks in full view, until at length they majestically bounded
off, leaving the authors of their alarm to measure the unexpected
distance to the position they had occupied. To
the right, and easy of access, was a projecting rock supporting
a single humble cedar in one of its fissures, from
which a stone let fall was received into the torrent of the
river which washed its base. The huge rampart of naked
rock which had been seen from below to stretch across
{196} the valley, was now in nearer view, the river whirling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
abruptly around the acute angle of its extremity, and offering
at its superior edge an embattled outline. They
ascended a primitive mountain, which seemed to be of a
superior elevation, in order to overlook the western ranges;
but found their horizon bounded by the succeeding mountains
towering majestically above them. To the east, over
the tops of a few inferior elevations, lay expanded the vast
interminable prairie over which we had so long held our
mountainous march. The undulations which swell its
surface now disappeared, and the whole lay like a map
before the observer. They could trace the course of the
Platte, and number the streams they had crossed, and
others which they had before passed near, by the slight
fringing of timber or bushes which margined their banks,
and by an occasional glimpse of their streams shining like
quicksilver, and interrupting and varying the continuity
of the plain as they pursued their serpentine course. The
atmosphere was remarkably serene, small clouds were
coursing over the surface of the heavens, casting their
swiftly moving shadows upon the earth, and enhancing
the beauty of the contrast which the long lines of timber
afforded to the general glare of light. After contemplating
for some time the beauty and extent of the scene, their
attention was attracted by a moving point, which occasionally
became visible by reflecting the rays of the retiring
sun. This object was our white flag, waving in a
gentle breeze, and revealing the position of our camp, the
only spot in the boundless landscape where the eye could
rest on the work of human hands. The descent towards
the river from this pinnacle was so precipitous, that much
caution was requisite in attempting to gain the river
towards which they now directed their course. Upon a
step or resting place were several ponderous masses of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
rock, which, by the application of a little force, were
readily overturned down the steep; and {197} we were
amused by marking their impetuous and rapidly increasing
motion as they rolled and bounded onward, until a
surge and wide-thrown spray announced their reception
into the bed of the river. Arriving at the river, it was
found necessary to pass along in the stream, the margin
not admitting sufficient foot-hold; this mode of progression,
however, soon proved too painful and laborious, as
the very unequal rocks with which the bottom was paved,
were invested with a slime, and refused repose to the foot,
the uncertain motion of which was only arrested by the
opposition of an angular fragment, or the intervention of
an interstice; we therefore again ascended the mountain
side, and at length regained the plain.</p>

<p>Astronomical observations were attempted at camp,
but in the middle of the day the moon was found to be too
near the sun, and in the evening the sky was cloudy.</p>

<p>The sickness experienced by almost all the party was
probably occasioned by eating of currants, which were
abundant about the camp. It is not to be supposed this
illness was caused by any very active deleterious quality
in the fruit, but that the stomach, by long disuse, had in
a great measure lost the power of digesting vegetable matter.
Several continued unwell during the night.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 9th [8th] of July<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> we resumed our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
journey, travelling somewhat east of south along a small
tributary of the Platte. The bed of this stream lies from
south to north along a narrow valley, bounded on each
side by high cliffs of sandstone. The rock is similar to
that already mentioned, its strata having, however, less
inclination than is observed nearer the base of the mountain.
It is the margin of that great formation of secondary
which occupies the plain, and appears as if broken off and
thrown into an inclined position by some convulsion which
changed the relative elevation of {198} the stratum. It is
of great thickness, its lamin&aelig; in an almost vertical position,
covering a surface of two or three, and sometimes
many miles in width. On the eastern declivities of the
first ranges of hills in places which may be supposed to
have occupied the surface of the stratum in its original
position, the rock is usually of a close grain and compact
texture, and of a yellowish white or light gray
colour.</p>

<p>We observed, in various parts of the valley which traverse
this sandstone district, several detached columnar
masses, many of them bearing a striking resemblance to
colossal ruins; also some insulated hills with perpendicular
sides and level summits. These seem to be the remains
of an extensive portion of the sandstone stratum
which formerly covered the country to the level of their
highest summits. They occur at considerable distance
from the base of the primitive mountain, and their summits
are occupied by horizontal strata of sandstone; for a
small portion of the upper part of their elevation their
sides are nearly perpendicular, but their bases are surrounded
by an extensive accumulation of <i>d&eacute;bris</i> sometimes
rising nearly to the summit. After ascending the
small stream before mentioned to its source, we crossed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
an inconsiderable ridge which separates it from the valley
of Defile Creek. This we ascended to the place where
its principal branch descends from the mountains. Here
we encamped with the intention of resting on the following
day, which was Sunday.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p>July 10th [9th]. A beautiful species of pigeon was shot
near the mountain. The head is of a purplish cinereous
colour; the back of the neck, and its sides, brilliant golden-green;
the feathers at base brownish purple; above this
patch, and at base of head, is a white semi-band; the
under part of the neck is pale vinaceous purplish; this
colour becomes paler as it approaches the vent, which,
with the inferior tail coverts, is white; anterior portion of
the back, the {199} wing coverts and scapulars are brownish
ash; the larger wing feathers dark brown, approaching
black; the exterior edges whitish; the lower part of the
back, the rump and tail coverts, inferior wing coverts and
sides, bluish ash; paler beneath the wings; the shafts of
the body-feathers and tail coverts are remarkably robust,
tapering rather suddenly near the tips; the tail is medial,
rounded at tip, consisting of twelve feathers, a definite
black band at two-thirds their length from the base, before
which the colour is bluish ash, and behind it dirty whitish;
the bill is yellow, tipped with black, and somewhat gibbous
behind the nostrils; the irides red; the feet yellow;
claws black.</p>

<p>This species seems to be most intimately connected to
the ring-tailed pigeon (C. carib&aelig;a), from which it differs
in the colour of the legs and bill, and in not having the
gibbosity at the base of the latter so remarkable. It is
possible that it may be an intermediate link between the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
ring-tailed pigeon and the stock pigeon of Europe, with
the latter of which it has, in common, the exterior white
edging to the greater wing feathers. It may be distinguished
by the name of band-tailed pigeon (columba
fasciata, Say); and may be seen, with other specimens of
natural objects collected on this expedition, in the Philadelphia
Museum.</p>

<p>Several of the tributaries to Defile creek appear to discharge
as much water as is seen in the stream below their
junction. This appearance is common to many of the
larger creeks, their broad and sandy beds allowing much
of the water to sink, and pass off through the sand. In
the evening, a favourable opportunity, the first for several
days, presented, and observations for latitude were taken.</p>

<p>That part of Defile creek, near which we encamped,
is filled with dams, thrown across by the beaver, causing
it to appear rather like a succession of ponds than a continued
stream. As we ascended {200} farther towards the
mountains, we found the works of these animals still more
frequent. The small willows and cotton-wood trees,
which are here in considerable numbers, afford them their
most favourite food.</p>

<p>At no great distance to the east of our camp was one of
these peculiar hills above mentioned. In visiting it we
crossed a ridge of sandstone, about three hundred feet in
height, with strata inclined to the west. To this succeeds
a valley, about one mile wide, having a scanty
growth of pine and oak. The ascent of the hill is steep
and rugged. Horizontal strata of sandstone and coarse
conglomerate are exposed on its sides, and the summit
is capped by thin stratum of compact sandstone, surmounted
by a bed of greenstone trap, or trappea porphyry.
The loose and splintery fragments of this rock sometimes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
cover the surface, making a clinking noise under the feet,
like fragments of pottery.</p>

<p>The summit of this hill is of an oval form, about eight
hundred yards in length and five hundred in breadth. Its
surface is undulating, and is terminated on all sides by
perpendicular precipices. The elevation of the hill is
about one thousand feet, and the height of the perpendicular
precipices, from the summit of the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> to the top
of hill, about fifty.</p>

<p>From the top of this hill, the high peak mentioned by
Captain Pike, was discovered, and its bearing found to be
S. 50. W.</p>

<p>Several of the party ascended Defile creek until they
arrived at the mountains, into which they penetrated as
far as was found practicable. As they travelled along the
bed of this, they found the several rock formations beautifully
exposed, and in the following order.</p>

<p>Commencing from the alluvial of the plain on the east,
they saw:</p>

<p>First, Horizontal sandstone, embracing extensive {201}
beds of coarse conglomeratic, and commonly of a light
gray or reddish yellow colour.</p>

<p>Second, Fine compact gray sandstone, containing a few
impressions of organized remains, resembling those in the
sandstones of coal formations. This rock is inclined at
an angle of near twenty degrees towards the west. It
forms continuous ranges of hills, not difficult of ascent
from the east, but their western declivities are abrupt and
precipitous.</p>

<p>Third, Lofty and detached columns of sandstone, of a
reddish or deep brown colour. These are irregularly
scattered throughout a narrow untimbered valley. Some
of them rise probably three hundred feet above the common
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
level of the plain, and are so steep on all sides as to preclude
the possibility of ascent. Others are accessible at
some points, and one of these we ascended. Sketches of
these singular rocks have been preserved both by Mr.
Peale and Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p>Fourth, Coarse white pudding-stone or conglomeratic
and sandstone, of a deep red colour, alternating with each
other, and with beds of fine white sandstone, and resting
against the granite in a highly inclined position. This
rock contains well preserved remains of terebratul&aelig;,
productus, and other bivalve shells. These are usually
found on or near the surface of large nodules of a fine
flinty stone, closely resembling petrosilex. The same
rock also contains an extensive bed of iron ore; and from
its eastern side flows a copious brine spring.</p>

<p>About this spring, which had evidently been much frequented
by animals, we saw the skulls of the male and
female big horn, the bones of elk, bisons, and other animals.</p>

<p>The granite, which succeeds the sandstone last mentioned,
is of a dark reddish brown colour, containing a
large proportion of felspar, of the flesh-coloured variety,
and black mica. The crystalline grains, or fragments of
the felspar, are large, and {202} detached easily, so that the
rock is in a state of rapid disintegration. This granite
rises abruptly in immense mountain masses, and undoubtedly
extends far to the west.</p>

<p>The little river, on which our camp is situated, pours
down from the rugged side of the granitic mountain
through a deep inaccessible chasm, forming a continued
cascade of several hundred feet. From an elevation of
one or two thousand feet on the side of the mountain, we
were able to overlook a considerable extent of secondary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
region at its base. The surface appeared broken for several
miles; and in many of the valleys we could discern
columnar and pyramidal masses of sand-rock, sometimes
entirely naked, and sometimes bearing little tufts of bushes
about their summits.</p>

<p>Here met with a female bird, which closely resembles,
both in size and figure, the female of the black game (tetrao
tetrix); it is, however, of a darker colour, and the
plumage is not so much banded; the tail also seems rather
longer, and the feathers of it do not exhibit any tendency
to curve outward, which, if we mistake not, is exhibited by
the inner feathers of the tail of the corresponding one of
the black game.</p>

<p>Its general colour is a black brown, with narrow bars
of pale ocraceous; plumage near the base of the beak
above tinged with ferruginous; each feather on the head,
with a single band and slight tip, those of the neck, back,
tail coverts, and breast, two bands and tip, the tips on the
upper part of the back and on the tail coverts are broad
and spotted with black, with the inferior band often obsolete;
the throat and inferior portion of the upper sides
of the neck are covered with whitish feathers, on each of
which is a black band or spot; a white band on each
feather of the breast, becoming broader on those nearer
the belly; on the belly, the plumage is dull cinereous with
concealed white lines on the shafts; {203} the wing coverts
and scapulars, about two banded with a spotted tip and
second band, and with the tip of the shaft white; the
primaries and secondaries have whitish zigzag spots on
their outer webs, the first feather of the former short, the
second longer, the third, fourth, and fifth equal, longest
feathers of the sides with two or three bands and white
spot at the tip of the shaft; inferior tail coverts, white with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
a black band and base, and slightly tinged with ocraceous
on their centres; legs feathered to the toes, and with the
thighs pale, undulated with dusky; tail rounded with a
broad terminal band of cinereous, on which are black
zigzag spots; on the intermediate feathers are several ocraceous
spotted bands, but these become obsolete and confined
to the exterior webs on the lateral feathers, until they
are hardly perceptible on the exterior pair; a naked space
above and beneath the eyes. It may be distinguished by
the name of the Dusky Grouse (tetrao obscurus, S.).</p>

<p>When this bird flew, it uttered a cackling note a little
like that of the domestic fowl; this note was noticed by
Lewis and Clarke in the bird which they speak of under the
name of the cock of the plains, and to which Mr. Ord has
applied the name of tetrao fusca; a bird which, agreeably
to their description, appears to be different from this, having
the legs only half booted; the "fleshy protuberance
about the base of the upper chop," and "the long pointed
tail" of that bird may possibly be sexual distinctions.</p>

<p>It appears by the observations of Lewis and Clarke,
that several species of this genus inhabit the country which
they traversed, particularly in this elevated range of mountains,
from whence, amongst other interesting animals,
they brought to Philadelphia a specimen of the spotted
grouse (T. canadensis); which, together with the above
described bird, are now preserved in the Philadelphia
Museum, thus proving that the spotted grouse is an inhabitant
of a portion of the territory of the United
States.</p>

<p>{204} In the evening, a thunder-storm rose in the east.
It appeared for some time to approach, the thunder being
loud and frequent, but at length moved off towards the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
south-east, continuing visible in the horizon during great
part of the night.</p>

<p>July 11th [10th and 11th]. From our encampment we
travelled nearly south, and crossing a small ridge dividing
the waters of the Platte from those of the Arkansa, we
halted to dine on a tributary of the latter river.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> In an
excursion from this place, we collected a large species of
columbine, somewhat resembling the common one of the
gardens. It is heretofore unknown to the flora of the
United States, to which it forms a splendid acquisition.
If it should appear not to have been described, it may receive
the name of aquilegia cœrulea.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> Our road during
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
the morning lay for about twelve miles close along the
foot of the primitive mountain, having on our left some of
the sandstone ridges and hills already described. On our
right, the brown and naked granite rose in shapeless
masses far above our heads; and occasionally, as we passed
the deep fissures worn by the descending torrents, we
caught a view of the distant summits glittering with
eternal frosts. In the valleys towards the east were many
insulated and lofty hills, with perpendicular sides, and
level table-like summits. They are sometimes disposed
in parallel, but interrupted ranges, and sometimes irregularly
scattered, without any appearance of order.
In every instance they were found to be the remains of
extensive beds of sandstone; insulated portions of which
had been preserved from disintegration, while all the contiguous
parts had crumbled down and been washed away.</p>

<p>One of these singular hills, of which Mr. Seymour has
preserved a sketch, was called the Castle Rock, on account
of its striking resemblance to a work of art. It has columns,
and porticoes and arches, and {205} when seen from a distance
has an astonishingly regular and artificial appearance.</p>

<p>July 12th. [10th and 11th cont'd.]. On approaching it,
the base is found enveloped in an extensive accumulation
of soil, intermixed with fragments of rapidly disintegrating
sandstone. The lower portions of the perpendicular sides
of the rock are of loosely cemented pudding-stone, but the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
summit is capped by a compact and somewhat durable
sand-rock. This is surmounted by a scanty soil, in which
are a few stinted oaks and junipers.</p>

<p>We had seen no bisons for several days, but in the
afternoon a few were discovered at a distance from our
course, and three men despatched in pursuit of them.
They were grazing on the side of a hill near a mile distant.
As provisions were growing scarce with us, we watched
the progress of the hunters with some anxiety. At length
the firing commenced, and we enjoyed a distant, though
distinct view of the animating spectacle of a bison hunt.
In a short time the hunters joined us with their horses
loaded with meat.</p>

<p>We halted to dine on the tributary of the Arkansa before
mentioned, nearly opposite the Castle Rock. Intermixed
with the grass upon which we sat down to our dinner, we
observed a small campanula, with a solitary terminal
flower, about as large as that of the common hare-bell
(C. decipiens). This species we believe to be identical
with the C. uniflora of Europe, which has not been heretofore
noticed in the United States.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we moved on, descending the little
stream on which we had halted for dinner. Like the small
branches of the Platte, it is inhabited by great numbers
of beavers; but it has more timber, and a more fertile soil
than any stream of similar magnitude we had lately passed.
Some light showers occurred in the middle of the day, and
at evening a thunder-storm was observed, in the same manner
{206} as on the preceding day, to collect in the east, and
after we had listened to its thunders for some time, it
moved off in the direction of the Arkansa, but no rain fell
where we were. In the course of the day several elk were
seen, and at evening we killed an antelope. Robins are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
here frequent, and a jerboa was seen resembling the
gerbillus canadensis; many fine plants were collected, several
of which are hitherto undescribed.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>Towards evening, our guide discovered we had already
passed considerably beyond the base of the peak, near
which it had been our intention to halt. He also perceived
at the same moment, he had arrived at the very spot where
some years ago he had been made prisoner by a party of
Spaniards, who took him to Santa F&eacute;.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> As we were particularly
desirous of visiting the mountains at the point
designated in many maps as the highest "peak," we resolved
to return upon our course, but as it was now near
sunset, we thought it advisable to encamp for the night.</p>

<p>Our journey in the afternoon had been pursued in a bison
path, and although not in the direction of our proper course,
and serving only to prolong our march without advancing
us towards the end of our pilgrimage, yet it brought us
near to that romantic scenery which for many days we had
chiefly contemplated with a distant eye. We entered the
secondary range along the margin of a deep ravine, which
wound with a serpentine course towards the base of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
mountain. Our progress was sometimes impeded by
huge rocky masses which had been precipitated from some
neighbouring height; and sometimes by a dense forest of
very limited extent, or an immense impending wall or
oblique buttress of rock, which, by its proximity to the eye,
vied with the grandeur of the ascending piles beyond.</p>

<p>July 12th. On the morning of the 12th we retraced
our path of the preceding day, until a small {207} stream
running towards the north-east offered us a change of
scenery, and a course more in the direction we wished to
pursue.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> The inequalities of the surface were greater
than in the route of the preceding evening. The precipitous
character of several of the passes thoroughly tested the
confidence we felt in our sure-footed, but now wearied and
exhausted Indian horses and mules. Our rude pathway
skirted along the base of an elevated ridge, on whose side,
far above our heads, projected a narrow ledge of rocks,
frowning defiance to all attempts to scale the steep. This
ledge declined gradually as we proceeded, until it terminated
abruptly on the edge of a profound gulph. Here
appeared to be the only spot at which the ridge could be
ascended. On the brow of the cliff, a fragment of rock and
a small portion of earth were suspended by the binding
roots of a solitary pine, offering a frail and precarious
foothold. This we chose to ascend, startling and hazardous
as the attempt appeared, rather than retrace our steps
for several miles, and search for a passage in some other
direction. The projecting ledge by which we had ascended,
had barely sufficient width to admit the passage of a
single individual at a time. When we had gained the
summit, we allowed our exhausted animals a moment's
rest in the partial shade of some straggling oaks, and contemplated,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
not without a feeling of terror, the yawning
gulph at our feet. This emotion was much enhanced by
reflecting, that a single misstep of a horse, or the sliding
of a fragment of stone in our narrow path, would have
been sufficient to have precipitated us into the abyss. We
thus pursued our route, marked out to us by the bisons,
who always trace the most direct and best course, until
turning the side of a mountain<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> of moderate elevation, the
ocean of prairie again spread before us. This monotonous
plain, of which we had been hitherto so weary, now burst
upon the sight, and for a moment {208} exhibited a cheerful
and pleasant contrast to the rude mountain ruins, that
we had with such toil and hazard been clambering over.
This charm was, however, soon to be dispelled. On descending
to the plain, it became as usual desirable to find
a good situation for an encampment, abounding with grass
for the horses, and convenient to a water course. For this
purpose, one of the party rode to a small line of timber
about a mile on our left, which ran in a parallel direction
to our line of march. He overtook us again at the distance
of two or three miles, having discovered a copious stream
of water. It was about three miles below the point at
which the water had been discovered that we gained the
line of timber, only to experience the mortification of disappointment
in finding a naked bed of sand, the stream
having, no doubt, sunk into the earth some distance above.
We had, therefore, to undergo the pains of abstinence still
longer, until we again sought the timber further below,
where the water had reappeared on the surface.</p>

<p>Near this encampment, we first observed the great
shrubby cactus<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> which forms so conspicuous a feature in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
the vegetable physiognomy of the plains of the Arkansa. Its
trunk is six or eight feet in height, and at the root five or six
inches in diameter. It is much branched, the ultimate divisions
consisting of long cylindric articulations. The flowers
are as large as those of the C. ferox, of a purple colour, and
are placed on the ends of the articulations. These last
are arranged somewhat in whorls about the ends of the
smaller branches. The surface of every part of the plant,
aside from its terrific armature of thorns, is marked by
little prominences of near an inch in length, and about
one-fourth of an inch in breadth, rising considerably,
and bearing a cluster of radiating spines. These are
of various lengths, one pointing {209} obliquely upward,
being commonly much the largest. At their insertion,
these thorns are surrounded by pungent set&aelig; in the manner
of C. ferox. The whole plant is so thickly beset with
strong spines pointing in every direction, that no large
animal can approach it unharmed. It does not form
thickets, but each plant is a cluster by itself; and when
first seen at a distance, they were mistaken for bisons. We
were informed by one of our engagees, who had penetrated
the Spanish provinces as far as Monterey, that this plant
is common there, and its fruit much esteemed. The nopals
are considered characteristic of warm and dry climates,
like those of Egypt and California.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> Perhaps there is
no part of the world where plants of this family constitute
so large a proportion of the vegetable products of the soil,
as in the arid plains of the Arkansa. These plains are
sufficiently dry; but like those of the Platte and Upper
Missouri, where cacti are almost equally abundant, they
are visited by very severe cold in winter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

<p>Another highly interesting plant, which occurs in the
most barren and desolate parts of the plain, is a cucurbitaceous
vine resembling some of our common squashes,
bearing a small pepo, which is round and smooth, and
as large as an orange. It is perennial, having a somewhat
lignous root four or five inches in diameter, and descending
often more than four feet into the earth. We were so fortunate
as to meet with it in flower, and also with ripened
fruit. It has the acutely margined seed of the genus
cucumis, but in other respects is closely allied to cucurbita.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>
In addition to these, we collected the zigadenus
elegans, Ph., asclepias tuberosa, and some others.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span></p>

<p>From an elevated ridge which we passed in the morning,
some bisons had been seen, at the distance {210} of five
miles; and as we were in want of game, Mr. Peale, with
two hunters, rode forward in the pursuit of them. They
overtook the herd near a small creek, and attacked one of
the largest, which was at length killed. In examining the
body, it was found twenty balls had entered in different
parts before the animal fell. They arrived at camp,
bringing the meat, at a little after noon.</p>

<p>The small stream on which we encamped had some
timber along its valley. In this, four deer had been killed;
so that we now had provisions in great plenty.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span></p>

<p>From this camp we had a distinct view of the part of the
mountains called by Captain Pike the highest peak. It
appeared about twenty miles distant, towards the north-west.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a>
Our view was cut off from the base by an intervening
spur of less elevation; but all the upper part of the
peak was visible, with patches of snow extending down to
the commencement of the woody region.</p>

<p>At about one o'clock <small>P. M.</small> a dense black cloud was seen
to collect in the south-west; and advancing towards the
peak, it remained nearly stationary over that part of the
mountains, pouring down torrents of rain. The thunder
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
was loud and frequent; and though little rain fell near our
camp, the creek soon began to swell; and before sunset it
had risen about six feet, and again subsided nearly to its
former level. When the stream began to rise, it was soon
covered with such a quantity of bison's dung, suddenly
washed in from the declivities of the mountains and the
plains at its base, that the water could scarcely be seen.
About this time our cook filled his kettle, and put into it
the meat intended for supper; but when the soup was
brought to our tent, the flavour of the cow-yard was found
so prevalent, and the meat so filled with sand, that very
little could be eaten.</p>

<p>{211} As one of the objects of our excursion was to ascertain
the elevation of the peak, it was determined to remain
in our present camp for three days, which would afford
an opportunity for some of the party to ascend the
mountain.

<h2 id="APPENDIX_B">{271} APPENDIX B</h2>

<h3>INDIAN LANGUAGE OF SIGNS</h3>

<p>1. <i>Sun</i>—The fore-finger and thumb are brought together
at tip, so as to form a circle, and held up towards
the sun's track. To indicate any particular time of
the day, the hand with the sign of the sun, is stretched
out towards the east horizon, and then gradually
elevated, to show the ascent of that luminary, until the
hand arrives in the proper direction, to indicate the part
of the heavens in which the sun will be at the given
time.</p>

<p>2. <i>Night, or sleeping</i>—The head, with the eyes closed,
is laterally inclined for a moment upon the hand. As
many times as this is repeated, so many nights are
indicated; very frequently the sign of the sun is traced
over the heavens, from east to west, to indicate the lapse
of a day, and precedes the motion; it also precedes the
following following—</p>

<p>3. <i>Darkness</i>—The hands extended horizontally forwards,
and back upwards, pass one over the other, two or
three times touching it.</p>

<p>4. <i>Combat</i>—The clenched hands are held about as high
as the neck, and five or six inches asunder, then waved
two or three times laterally, to show the advances and
retreats of the combatants; after which the fingers of each
hand are suffered to spring from the thumb towards each
other, as in the act of sprinkling water, to represent the
flight of missiles.</p>

<p>5. <i>Prisoner</i>—The fore finger and thumb of the left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
hand are held in the form of a semicircle, opening towards
and near the breast, and the fore finger {272} of the right
representing the prisoner, is placed upright within the
curve, and passed from one side to another, in order to
show that it will not be permitted to pass out.</p>

<p>6. <i>Man</i>—A finger held vertically.</p>

<p>7. <i>Seeing</i>—The fore-finger, in the attitude of pointing,
is passed from the eye towards the real or imaginary object.</p>

<p>8. <i>Seen, or discovered</i>—The sign of a man, or other
animal, is made; after which the finger is pointed towards,
and approached to your own eye; it is the preceding sign
reversed.</p>

<p>9. <i>Entering a house or lodge</i>—The left hand is held
with the back upward, and the right hand also with the
back up, is passed in a curvilinear direction down under the
other, so as to rub against its palm, then up on the other
side of it. The left hand here represents the low door of
the skin lodge, and the right, the man stooping down to
pass in.</p>

<p>10. <i>Theft</i>—The left fore-arm is held horizontally, a
little forward or across the body, and the right hand passing
under it with a quick motion, seems to grasp something,
and is suddenly withdrawn.</p>

<p>11. <i>Hunting</i>—The fore-finger is brought near the eye,
and placed in the attitude of pointing; it is then wagged
from side to side, the eye following its devious motion, and
seeming to look in the direction indicated. Sometimes the
hand is extended far before the eye, and the same motion
is given to the finger.</p>

<p>12. <i>Pretty</i>—The fingers and thumb, so opposed as to
form a curve, are passed over the face nearly touching
it, from the forehead to the chin, then add the sign of
<i>Good</i>, No. 42.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span></p>

<p>13. <i>Eating</i>—The fingers and thumb are brought together
in opposition to each other, into something of a
wedge shape, and passed to and from the mouth four or
five times within the distance of three or four {273} inches
of it, to imitate the action of food passing to the mouth.</p>

<p>14. <i>Drinking, or water</i>—The hand is partially clenched,
so as to have something of a cup shape; and the opening
between the thumb and finger is raised to the mouth, as in
the act of drinking. If the idea of water only is to be
conveyed, the hand does not stop at the mouth, but is
continued above it.</p>

<p>15. <i>Enough, or a bellyful</i>—The sign for eating is first
made; then the fore finger and thumb are opposed to each
other so as to form a semicircular curve, which is elevated
along the body from the belly to the neck, in order to indicate
that the interior is filled with food up to that part.</p>

<p>16. <i>Squaw</i>—The hands are passed from the top down
each side of the head, indicating the parting of the hair
on the top, and its flowing down each side.</p>

<p>17. <i>The discharging of a gun</i>—Is indicated by slapping
the back of the right hand, partially closed, into the palm
of the left.</p>

<p>18. <i>Death</i>—By throwing the fore finger from the perpendicular
into a horizontal position towards the earth,
with the back downwards.</p>

<p>19. <i>Killing</i>—The hands are held with the edge upwards,
and the right hand strikes the other transversely,
as in the act of chopping. This sign seems to be more
particularly applicable to convey the idea of death, produced
by a blow of the tomahawk or war-club.</p>

<p>20. <i>Bison</i>—The two fore fingers are placed near the
ears, projecting, so as to represent the horns of the animal.</p>

<p>21. <i>Surrounding the bison</i>—The sign No. 20 is first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
made; the hands, with the fore fingers and thumbs in a
semicircle, are then brought two or three times together.</p>

<p>22. <i>Discharging the arrow</i>—The hands are placed
{274} as in the attitude of drawing the arrow in the bow,
(this is also the sign for the bow) and its departure is indicated
by springing the fingers from the thumbs, as in the
act of sprinkling water.</p>

<p>23. <i>To speak</i>—The motion is like sprinkling water
from the mouth by springing the fore finger from the
thumb, the hand following a short distance from the mouth
at each resilience, to show the direction of the word, or to
whom it is addressed; this motion is repeated three or four
times.</p>

<p>24. <i>Haranguing</i>—The above motion repeated rapidly,
the hand at each motion pursuing a different direction, to
show that the talk is addressed to various persons.</p>

<p>25. <i>Quantity, or great number</i>—The hands and arms
are passed in a curvilinear direction outwards and downwards,
as if we were showing the form of a large globe;
then the hands are closed and elevated, as if something
was grasped in each hand, and held up about as high as
the face.</p>

<p>26. <i>Exchange</i>—The two fore fingers are extended perpendicularly,
and the hands are then passed by each other
transversely in front of the breast, so as nearly to exchange
positions.</p>

<p>27. <i>Inquiry</i>—The hand held up with the thumb near
the face, and the palm directed towards the person of
whom the inquiry is making; it is then rotated upon the
wrist two or three times edgewise, to denote uncertainty.</p>

<p>28. <i>Truth</i>—The fore finger passed, in the attitude of
pointing, from the mouth forward in a line curving a little
upward, the other fingers being carefully closed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span></p>

<p>29. <i>Lie</i>—The fore and middle fingers extended, passed
two or three times from the mouth forward; they are
joined at the mouth, but separate as they depart from it,
indicating that the words go in different directions.</p>

<p>{275} 30. <i>It is so</i>—The motion is somewhat like 28., but
the finger is held rather more upright, and is passed nearly
straight forward from opposite the breast; and when at
the end of its course, it seems gently to strike something,
though with a rather slow and not suddenly accelerated
motion.</p>

<p>31. <i>Sit down</i>—The fist is clenched, and the motion of
it is then the same as if it held a staff, and gently stamped
it upon the earth two or three times.</p>

<p>32. <i>Travelling with great rapidity</i>—The hands are
held edge up, extended forward and a little sideways, one
in advance of the other, though parallel; they then are
agitated a little in the manner of a fan, though with a much
more rapid and not so wide a motion, the arms being at
rest.</p>

<p>33. <i>Running</i>—The arm nearly doubled upon itself,
and then the elbow thrown forward and backward, as in
the act of running.</p>

<p>34. <i>Riding on horseback</i>—The index and middle
finger of the right hand are straddled over the left index
finger, representing the rider and the horse; these are
then jolted forward, to represent the trotting motion of
the horse.</p>

<p>35. <i>Knife</i>—Hold the left hand clenched near the
mouth, as if it held one end of a strip of meat, the other
end of which was between the teeth; then pass the edge of
the right hand, as in the act of cutting, obliquing a little
upwards from right to left between the other hand and
mouth, so as to appear to divide the supposed meat.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span></p>

<p>36. <i>Awl</i>—The left fore finger is extended, and the
right, also extended, is placed across it, and is then turned
on its axis, so as to imitate the action of the awl in making
a hole.</p>

<p>37. <i>My offspring</i>—If an Indian wishes to tell you that
an individual present is his offspring, he points to the person;
and then, with the finger still extended, {276} passes
it forward from his loins in a line curving downwards;
then slightly upwards; sometimes saying, "That is my
child, <i>illum minxi</i>." Dashinga-shinga-we-weet-tah-ohn-na-je.</p>

<p>38. <i>Strength</i>—The hands are clenched; the left fore
arm is held almost perpendicularly near the breast, so that
the fist is nearly opposite to the throat; the right arm is
then carried up between the left and the breast, and continued
on over the left fist to the outside of the latter; the
right arm is then brought down so as to have the same
direction with the other, and the fists rest opposite to each
other, in a line with the breast. This motion resembles
the act of wringing a thick towel. If he would say, "I am
strong," he strikes himself upon the breast two or three
times with his fist, previously to the motion above described.
If he would say, "You are strong," he previously
points to you, &amp;c.</p>

<p>39. <i>Fire</i>—The act of striking fire with the flint and
steel is represented; after which the ascent of the smoke is
indicated, by closing the fingers and thumb of the right
hand, holding them in a vertical position, with the hand as
low as convenient; the hand is then gradually elevated,
and the fingers and thumb a little expanded, to show the
ascent and expansion of the volume of smoke.</p>

<p>40. <i>Rabbit</i>—The fore and little fingers of the right
hand are extended, representing the ears of the animal;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
the hand is then bobbed forward to show the leaping
motion of the animal.</p>

<p>41. <i>Deer</i>—The fore finger of the right hand is extended
vertically, with the back towards the breast; it is then
turned from side to side, to imitate the motion of the tail
of the animal when he walks at his leisure.</p>

<p>42. <i>Good</i>—The hand held horizontally, back upwards,
describes with the arm a horizontal curve outwards.</p>

<p>{277} 43. <i>Be quiet, or be not alarmed, or have patience</i>—The
palm of the hand is held towards the person.</p>

<p>45. <i>I will kill you</i>—Direct the right hand towards the
offender, and spring the fingers from the thumb, as in the
act of sprinkling water.</p>

<p>46. <i>Fish</i>—Hold the upper edge of the hand horizontally,
and agitate it in the manner of a fan, but more
rapidly, in imitation of the motion of the tail of the fish.</p>

<p>47. <i>Poor</i>—The two fore fingers extended, with the right,
as if it was a knife, imitate the motion of cutting the flesh
off of the left finger, beginning towards the tip, and cutting
with a quick motion directed towards the base; at the
same time turn the left finger a little round, so as to expose
the different parts to the action of cutting; intimating that
the flesh has diminished from starvation.</p>

<p>48. <i>House or lodge</i>—The two hands are reared together
in the form of the roof of a house, the ends of the
fingers upward.</p>

<p>49. <i>Husband, companion, or in company</i>—The two
fore fingers are extended and placed together, with their
backs upward.</p>

<p>50. <i>Snow</i>—The hand is held up about as high as the
head, with the fingers suffered to dangle downwards; it is
then bobbed a little up and down, as if to throw off drops
from the ends of the fingers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span></p>

<p>51. <i>Rain</i>—The sign for <i>water</i> (No. 14.) precedes that
for <i>snow</i>.</p>

<p>52. <i>Robe</i>—The hands are placed near the shoulders,
as if holding the ends of the robe, and then crossed, as if
drawing the robe tight around the shoulders.</p>

<p>53. <i>The coming of a person from a distance</i>—Place the
fore finger in a vertical position, with the arm extended
towards the point from which the person came, or is to
come; then bring it gradually near the {278} body, but not
in contact with it; or if he continued on, carry it in the
direction he passed.</p>

<p>54. <i>Snake</i>—The fore finger is extended horizontally,
and passed along forward in a serpentine line. This is
also used to indicate the Snake nation of Indians.</p>

<p>55. <i>Crow nation of Indians</i>—The hands held out each
side, and striking the air in the manner of flying.</p>

<p>61. <i>Black-foot nation</i>—The finger and thumb encircle
the ancle.</p>

<p>62. <i>Arrapaho nation</i>—The fingers of one hand touch
the breast in different parts, to indicate the tattooing of
that part in points.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span></p>

<p>63. <i>Carrying a pack</i>—The hands are placed each side
of the head, as if they held the strap of the <i>hoppas</i>, which
passes round the forehead, in order to relieve that part, by
supporting a portion of the weight of the burden; with
this motion, two or three slight inclinations of the head
and corresponding movements of the hands are also made.</p>

<p>64. <i>Pretty</i>—Another sign, beside that marked {279}
No. 43., is the following: curve the fore finger of the right
hand, and place the tip on the ridge of the nose between
the eyes, so as to represent a high Roman nose; then bring
down the hand in a curvilinear manner, until the wrist
touches the breast; after which add the sign, No. 42.</p>

the hand is then held vertically above the head, and
rotated on the wrist two or three times.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span></p>

<p>71. <i>Swiftness</i>—The two index fingers are held parallel
together, and pointing forward; the right one is then passed
rapidly forward.</p>

<p>72. <i>Shienne nation</i>—With the index finger of the right
hand proceed as if cutting the left arm in different places,
with a sawing motion from the wrist upwards, to represent
the cuts or burns on the arms of that nation.</p>

<p>73. <i>Left-handed</i>—The left hand clenched is held {280}
up before the neck; the elbow is then brought in to the
side, at the same time giving to the fore-arm a twist, so as
to bring the closed palm opposite the breast.</p>

<p>74. <i>I do not understand</i>—The fingers and thumb of the
right hand brought together near their tips, and then approached
and receded to and from the ear two or three
times, with a quick motion, made within the distance of
two or three inches; finish with the sign, No. 65.</p>

<p>75. <i>I understand</i>—The same sign with the preceding,
excepting the No. 65., which is omitted. The motion of
the fingers is designed to represent the sound entering the
ear.</p>

<p>76. <i>Love or affection</i>—The clenched hand pressed hard
upon the breast.</p>

<p>77. <i>Me (I)</i>—The clenched hand struck gently, and
with a quick motion, two or three times upon the breast.
Or, the fingers brought together, are placed perpendicularly
upon the breast.</p>

<p>78. <i>You</i>—Is expressed by simply pointing at the persons,
and the same for other objects within view.</p>

<p>79. <i>Multitude</i>—First indicate a man, No. 6., or whatever
object it may be, and then the sign of a great many,
No. 25.</p>

<p>80. <i>Opposite</i>—A clenched hand held up on each side
of the head, at the distance of a foot or more from it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span></p>

<p>81. <i>Hill</i>—A clenched hand held up on the side of the
head, at the distance of a foot or more from it.</p>

<p>82. <i>River</i>—The hand, in the form of a scoop or ladle,

drawn along in a horizontal line, with the edge downward,
about the height of the breast.</p>

<p>83. <i>Counting, or enumeration</i>—The fingers or thumbs
expanded, count ten. In order to proceed with the enumeration
by tens, the hands must be {281} clenched; and if
again expanded, it counts twenty, and so on, the hands
being clenched between every ten. In order to indicate
the digits, clench the hands, and extend the little finger of
the left hand for one; extend also the ring finger for two,
and so on; the thumb for five. These must remain extended,
whilst the thumb of the right is extended for six,
&amp;c. Any number within five, above any number of tens,
is indicated by clenching the left hand and crossing the
right over it, with the requisite number of fingers extended.
For the number of sixteen, exhibit the sign of ten, and then
extend four fingers, and the two thumbs in the order of
enumeration; for seventeen, proceed by extending the fore
finger of the right hand, and so on to twenty. In this
manner any sum can be denoted, always holding the backs
of the hands upward. When enumerating a small number,
where a considerable exertion of the memory is
requisite, the Indians extend the left hand with the palm
upward; whilst, with the index of the right, the fingers are
successively bent into the palm, beginning as before with
the little finger; and the greater difficulty in recalling to
mind the numbers or events, the more apparent resistance
is offered to the inflection of the finger.</p>

<p>84. <i>A Chief</i>—The fore finger of the right hand extended,
pass it perpendicularly downward; then turn it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
upward, and raise it in a right line as high as the
head.</p>

<p>85. <i>Bad</i>—Make the sign of <i>good</i> (No. 42.), and then
that of <i>not</i> (No. 65.)</p>

the gun when directed horizontally, and with the
right appear to cock it.</p>

<p>87. <i>Gunpowder</i>—Appear to take up a pinch of the
powder, and to rub it between the finger and thumb; then
turning the hand, spring the fingers from the thumb upward,
so as to represent the exploding of the powder.</p>

<p>{282} 88. <i>Ball, or bullet</i>—Make the sign of the exploding
of the powder; then grasp the fore finger of the hand
with the remaining fingers and thumb, so that the tip of it
will so extend beyond them as to represent the ball.</p>

<p>89. <i>Scissors</i>—With the fore and middle fingers, imitate
the opening and shutting of the blades of the scissors.</p>

<p>90. <i>Looking-glass</i>—The palm of the hand held before
the face, the fingers pointing upward.</p>

finger, in the palm of the opposite hand.</p>

<p>92. <i>Brother</i>—The sign for a man (No. 6.), succeeded
by placing the ends of the fore and middle fingers of one
hand together in the mouth.</p>

<p>93. <i>Sister</i>—The sign for a squaw (No. 16.); after
which place the fingers in the mouth, as in No. 92.</p>

<p>94. <i>Cold</i>—The arms, with clenched hands, held up
before the breast, thrown into a tremulous motion as if
shivering with cold.</p>

<p>95. <i>Cowardice</i>—The head stooped down, and the arm
thrown up to protect it; a quick motion.</p>

<p>96. <i>Marching, or travelling moderately</i>—The hand held
vertically as high as the neck, with slightly divided fingers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
and rocked edgewise forward and backward upon the
wrist, extending the arm a little forwards. This sign resembles
that for <i>inquiry</i> (No. 27.), but differs in the direction
of the motion of the hand.</p>

<p>97. <i>The return of a party through fear</i>—Begin with the
preceding motion; then draw the tips of the fingers and
thumb together, and retreat the hand to the body.</p>

<p>98. <i>Hunting shirt</i>—The fore finger and thumb, so
opposed as to form a curve, are passed near the surface
of the body, from the forehead to the abdomen.</p>

<p>99. <i>Surprise or astonishment</i>—Is indicated by placing
the hand upon the mouth, to show that {283} language is
inadequate to communicate their sensations.</p>

<p>100. <i>Calumet dance</i>—The hand extended with the
edge upward, and with the arm waved sideways, with a
motion like that of a swing.</p>

<p>101. <i>Beaver trap</i>—The two fore fingers brought suddenly
together, in a parallel manner, so as to represent the
snapping of the steel trap.</p>

<p>102. <i>Stone</i>—Close the right hand, and strike the palm
of the left hand two or three times with it.</p>

<p>103. <i>Give it to me</i>—The hand extended in a pointing
position towards the object in request; then brought
towards the body with the finger raised vertically, and
laid against the breast.</p>

<p>104. <i>Mountains</i>—When speaking of the Rocky Mountains,
Tarrarecawaho held up the fingers of his left hand,
a little diverging from each other; and to convey the idea
of the streams flowing from them, he placed the index
finger of his right hand alternately between each two of
them, and drew it away in a serpentine manner.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following signs are extracted from an essay by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
William Dunbar, Esq., published in the sixth volume of
the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society.
It will be observed that some of them differ essentially
from those which we obtained, and that we have omitted
ten of them which correspond with those we have given.</p>

<p><i>White</i>—With the under side of the fingers of the right
hand rub gently upon that part of the left hand which
corresponds with the knitting of the bones of the fore
finger and thumb.</p>

<p><i>Egg</i>—The right hand held up with the fingers and
thumb extended, and approaching each other as if holding
an egg within.</p>

<p><i>The same, or similar to what went before</i>—Place the
two fore fingers parallel to each other, and push them forward
a little.</p>

<p>{284} <i>Snow</i>—Begin with the sign of rain, then the sign
of air or cold, and conclude with the sign of white.</p>

<p><i>Ice</i>—Begin with the sign of water, then of cold, then
the earth; and, lastly, a stone, with the sign of sameness
or similarity.</p>

<p><i>Hail</i>—Begin with the sign of water, then the sign of
cold, next the sign of a stone, then the same, then the sign
of white; and, lastly, conclude, with the sign of an egg;
all which, combined, give the idea of hail.</p>

<p><i>Frost</i>—Begin with the sign of water, then the sign of
night or darkness, then the sign of cold, then the sign of
white; and, lastly, the earth.</p>

<p><i>Cloud</i>—Begin with the sign of water; then raise the
two hands as high as the forehead, and placing them with
an inclination of 15&deg;, let them gently cross one another.</p>

<p><i>Fire</i>—The two hands brought near the breast, touching
or approaching each other, and half shut; then moved
outwards moderately quick, the fingers being extended,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
and the hands a little separated at the same time, as if to
imitate the appearance of flame.</p>

<p><i>Bring, fetch, or give me</i>—The hand half shut, with the
thumbs pressing against the fore finger, being first moderately
extended either to the right or left, is brought with a
moderate jerk to the opposite side, as if something was
pulled along by the hand. Consequently, the sign of
water preceding this, would convey the expression, "Give
me water."</p>

<p><i>Earth</i>—The two hands open and extended, brought
horizontally near each other opposite to either knee, then
carried to the opposite side, and raised in a curve movement,
until brought round and opposite to the face.</p>

<p><i>Cold, or Air</i>—The right hand held perpendicularly
upwards, and brought forwards with a tremulous or vibratory
motion, until it passes beyond the face.</p>

<p><i>Big, great, or large</i>—The two hands open, placed
{285} wide apart on each side of the body, and moved
forwards.</p>

<p><i>Fear, to be afraid, to cause fear</i>—The two hands, with
the fingers turned inwards, opposite to the lower ribs;
then brought upwards with a tremulous movement, as if
to represent the common idea of the heart rising up to the
throat: the three last signs, placed in the order given,
would convey the idea of a violent hurricane.</p>

<p><i>Moon</i>—The thumb and finger open are elevated
towards the right ear; this last sign is generally preceded
by the sign of the night, or darkness.</p>

<p><i>Heat</i>—The two hands raised as high as the head, and
bending forwards horizontally, with the points of the fingers
curving a little downwards.</p>

<p><i>Clear</i>—The hands are uplifted, and spread both ways
from the head.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span></p>

<p><i>Thunder</i>—The sign of rain, accompanied by the voice
imitating the rumbling sound of thunder.</p>

<p><i>Lightning</i>—First, the sign of thunder; then open or
separate the hands; and, lastly, bring the right hand down
towards the earth, in the centre of the opening just made.</p>

<p><i>Male and female</i>—Note: to distinguish between the
male and female, in all cases add for the male a fillip with
the fore finger of the right hand on the cheek; and, for the
female, bring the two hands open towards the breast, the
fingers approaching, and then move them outwards.</p>

<p><i>Dunghill fowl</i>—Bring the thumb and fingers of the
right hand together; and holding the hand moderately
elevated, move it across, imitating the motion of the head
of a cock in walking.</p>

<p><i>Turkey</i>—The open hands brought up opposite to the
shoulders, and imitating slowly the motion of the wings
of a bird; to which add the last sign.</p>

<p>{286} <i>Duck</i>—The last sign; then the sign of water; and,
lastly, the sign of swimming; which last is performed by
the fore finger of the right hand extended outwards, and
moved to and fro.</p>

<p><i>Horse</i>—The right hand, with the edge downwards, the
fingers joined, the thumb recumbent, extended forwards.</p>

<p><i>Deer</i>—The right hand extended upwards by the right
ear, with a quick puff from the mouth.</p>

<p><i>Man</i>—With the fore finger of the right hand extended,
and the hand shut, describe a line, beginning at the pit of
the stomach, and passing down the middle of the body as
far as the hand conveniently reaches, holding the hand a
moment between the lower extremities.</p>

<p><i>Woman</i>—The finger and thumb of the right hand
partly open, and placed as if laying hold of the breast.</p>

<p><i>Child</i>—Bring the fingers and thumb of the right hand,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
and place them against the lips; then draw them away,
and bring the right hand against the fore of the left, as if
holding an infant. Should the child be male, prefix the
sign of a man before the last sign; and, if a female, do so
by the sign of the woman.</p>

<p><i>Boy</i>—Bring the fingers and thumb of the right hand
to touch the lips; then extend the hands and make the sign
of man; then raise the hand, with the fingers upwards,
placed at the height of a boy.</p>

<p><i>Girl</i>—Begin with the above sign, and make the sign
of woman; and then raise the hand to the height of the girl.</p>

<p><i>You</i>—The hand held upwards obliquely, and pointing
forward.</p>

<p><i>He, or another</i>—The fore fingers extended, and the
hands shut, and fingers brought over one another, or
nearly touching, and then separated moderately quick.</p>

<p>{287} <i>Many, or much</i>—The flat of the right hand patting
on the back of the left hand; which is repeated in proportion
to the greater or lesser quantity.</p>

<p><i>Know</i>—The fore finger of the right hand held up
nearly opposite to the nose, and brought with a half-turn
to the right, and carried a little outwards. Place any of
the articles before the last sign, which will then signify,
"I know, you know, he knows;"—both hands being
made use of in the manner described, implies, "to know
much."</p>

<p><i>Now, or at present</i>—The two hands forming each a
hollow, and brought near each other, and put in a tremulous
motion upwards and downwards.</p>

<p><i>Come here</i>—The hand stretched outwards, with the
palm under, and brought back with a curve motion downwards,
and inclining to the body.</p>

<p><i>Go</i>—The back of the hand stretched out and upwards.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span></p>

<p><i>What say you</i>—The palm of the hand upwards, and
carried circularly outwards and depressed.</p>

<p><i>No, nothing, I have none</i>—The hand held up before
the face, with the palm outward, and vibrated to and fro.</p>

<p><i>From whence come you? say</i>—First, the sign of you;
then the hand extended, open, and drawn to the breast;
and, lastly, the sign of, "what say you?"</p>

<p><i>Come</i>—The fore-finger moved from right to left, with
an interrupted motion, as if imitating the alternate movement
of stepping.</p>

<p><i>Mine</i>—The hand shut, and held up to the view.</p>

<p><i>House</i>—The hand half open, and the fore finger extended
and separated; then raise the hand upwards, and
give it a half turn, as if screwing something.</p>

<p><i>Done, or finished</i>—The hands placed edge up and
down, parallel to each other; the right hand without;
which latter is drawn back, as if cutting something.</p>

<p><i>Spring season</i>—The sign of cold, to which add the last
sign of being done or finished.</p>

<p><i>Body</i>—The hands with the fingers pointed to the lower
part of the body, and then drawn upwards.</p>

<p><i>Hair</i>—The movement of combing.

<h3>INDIAN SPEECHES</h3>

<p class="hang">Speeches of Pawnees, Pawnee Loups, and Pawnee Republicans,
at a council held at the Engineer Cantonment,
October, 1819.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> concluding his address, on opening the Pawnee council,
Major O'Fallon requested them, if any subject rested
heavily on their minds, to come forward and express themselves
without fear. Long Hair (Tarrarecawaho,) immediately
arose, and with a firm step placed himself in the
middle of the area. He stood for a short time immovable,
then slowly advanced nearer to the agent, and with a very
loud, powerful voice, fierce countenance, and vehement
gesticulation, thus addressed him:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Father, The Master of Life placed me on this land, and
what should I fear? Nothing. You are a chief, and I
am a chief.</p>

<p>Father, Look at me, and see if I deceive you, when I
say that I have but one intention, and that is a good one.</p>

<p>Father, My heart is strong; I say, my heart is strong.</p>

<p>Father, Those who robbed and whipped your people, I
did not see; I was not present.</p>

<p>Father, Those Republican Pawnees are bad people,
they have injured the whites, but I have not, and that is
the reason why I am not afraid to see you.</p>

<p>{290} Father, We are fond of pipes; we like to travel to
our neighbouring nations, and smoke with them.</p>

<p>Father, I am desirous to go now, and hunt the buffaloe;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
but when the grass comes up in the spring, I hope to see
you again.</p>

<p>Father, This medal which you see on my neck, is my
father's image. It is dear to me, because he presented
and placed it on my neck.</p>

<p>Father, Wherever I have been to visit my father (Governor
Clarke), or my fathers, I have heard good talk, and
mine has been good also; but there are many here who
will not give ear to their words.</p>

<p>Father, I am happy to hear what you say about peace;
that we particularly desire, especially with the whites.</p>

<p>Father, Affairs have been bad. I am not a child; I
listened to the talk you sent to us, and was therefore not
afraid to come and see you. Those whites, and all those
people around me, I consider as my children, and am glad
to see them.</p>

<p>I tell you that I am poor; who is the cause of it? not
myself; it is my young men. That is all I have to say.
I give you my hand.</p>

<h4><i>La-ceech-ne-sha-ru</i>, the Knife Chief, a Pawnee Loup.</h4>

<p>Father, Here I am before you. You see me. I am
poor.</p>

<p>Father, I am a Pawnee wolf, and those you see there
(pointing to his band) are Pawnee wolves.</p>

<p>Father, Look at my people, and see if they have any
thing belonging to a white man.</p>

<p>Father, I tell you the truth, I am poor.</p>

<p>Father, Amongst my people, I believe, there is not an
individual that has injured you. If any one of the other
bands can say they have, let them speak.</p>

<p>Father, This medal which hangs upon my breast, I received
from my red-headed father below (Governor {291}
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
Clarke). I listened to his words, and on my return I told
them to my people, and they believed.</p>

<p>Father, You see that I am old; but I do not recollect
that myself, or any of my people, ever injured any of the
whites.</p>

<p>Father, Neither my hands, nor those of my young men,
have ever been stained with the blood of the Americans.</p>

<p>Father, That is the reason why I have come to listen
again in the words of my father.</p>

<p>Father, That is all I have to say. I have finished.</p>

<h4><i>Major O'Fallon</i></h4>

<p>Grand Pawnees, and Pawnee Republicans; I am not
satisfied with what you have said. What you have said
is good, but it is not enough. Until you drive those
dogs from among you, I will not consider you in any other
light than as dogs.</p>

<h4><i>Pa-ne-ca-he-ga</i>, Fool Robe's son, a Pawnee Republican.</h4>

<p>Father, I am a Pawnee Republican.</p>

<p>Father, What you have said is true: the Pawnee Republicans
are dogs, they do not listen with their ears.</p>

<p>Father, I have never done ill to a white man myself; I
have never even taken a knife from him; and my heart is
distressed because my young people will not listen.</p>

<p>Father, It is true what Tar-ra-re-ca-wa-ho has said,
that we whipped two white men; we did do it.</p>

<p>Father, I am poor; I say, I am poor.</p>

<p>Father, It is true that it is customary for my people to
rob white men, when they go to war, but I never knew
them to kill one.</p>

<p>Father, My heart is distressed because my young men
will not listen; they have no ears.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span></p>

<p>{292} Father, The offenders have not ears; they were
afraid to come and see you, knowing they had done wrong.</p>

<p>Father, I came without fear, on a good horse, which I
present to you. My people were afraid that I should
come.</p>

<p>Father, I am without fear. I said, when I set out from
my village, why should I fear, if my father strikes me, it
is no more than a father does to his child.</p>

<p>Father, We are glad to hear your words; we will make
peace; we will return to our village, and see what those
dogs will do.</p>

<p>Father, That is all I have to say. I have done.</p>

<h4><i>Chief of the Tappage band</i> of the Grand Pawnees.</h4>

<p>Father, I have come to see you; here I am, very poor.</p>

<p>Father, I have seen my father below, and this is my
great father I wear round my neck.</p>

<p>Father, When he put this about my neck I heard what
he said to me, and have recollected it.</p>

<p>Father, Our young people will not attend to what we
say; we talk and repeat to them, but when they lie down,
they forget all before midnight.</p>

<p>Father, You ought to have heard whether my band
have injured you or not.</p>

<p>Father, There was a time when our hands were red
with the blood of your people, but since we have been
below, it has been washed off.</p>

<p>Father, We visited our father below; he told us, when
we met a white man to treat him well, and let him never
fear.</p>

<p>Father, I see you are looking on me; I am poor; I have
nothing on me of the make of the whites; I have even
turned my buffaloe robe to hide its tarnish.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span></p>

<p>Father, I came here to listen to your words, to hear
what you have told us.</p>

<p>{293} Father, You say there is a God above; I know it;
when he is angry I hear him speak (alluding to the thunder).</p>

<p>Father, I consider you equal to him. You are the same
to me.</p>

<p>Father, All you see here are your children; they are poor.</p>

<p>Father, That is all I have to say.</p>

<h4><i>Major O'Fallon</i></h4>

<p>Pawnee chiefs and soldiers; I called you here to adjust
the difference that is between us. I called you here to
bring the articles which were stolen from my people. I
have not yet seen them. I called you here to bring the
dogs that stole them; but I have not seen them; I hope that
you have brought them.</p>

<p>My eyes have been looking for them, and my ears have
been listening, but I am not satisfied.</p>

<h4>(The following articles were now given up.</h4>

<p>One buffaloe robe, one horse, one pair double-barrelled
pistols, one bird-bag, one tomahawk, one axe, one powder-flask,
one shot-bag.</p>

<p>Fool Robe's son said, there are many articles lost, which
my people took from you, and two of the horses gave out
on the road, a few miles from this place.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a>)</p>

<h4><i>Long Hair</i></h4>

<p>Those who did the mischief did not come. They were
afraid. Here are two of their chiefs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span></p>

<h4><i>Major O'Fallon</i></h4>

<p>Pawnee chiefs and warriors; I wish to know whether
or not you are able to punish the offenders; {294} whether
or not there are good people enough amongst you to punish
them. Our soldiers are anxious to march against you,
but the chiefs restrain them, lest they injure the innocent.
That is the reason why I wish to know if you are not able
to punish the bad. Our people do not wish to spill innocent
blood. Therefore I desire to place their punishment
in your own hands.</p>

<p>I have come to this land, not to spill blood, but to prevent
its flowing. I have come to give you rest, and peace,
and happiness, not to make war. If your arms are not
strong enough, come forward and say so; if you are not
chiefs, say so.</p>

<p>Pawnees, If I were to see our troops marching towards
your nation, tears would fall from my eyes; because I believe
that there are some good men among you, whose
blood would immediately flow. Red Skins have called us
cowards when we have hesitated to spill blood, when it
ought to have been spilt. Even some of your chiefs have
insulted our people, thinking they would not resent it. I
tell you, Pawnees, that we are tired of submitting to insults.
My nation is most powerful, and that is the reason
why the Great Spirit restrains our arm.</p>

<p>Come forward, you chiefs, and let me know what is the
strength of your arm; my ears are anxious to hear; say,
before it is too late, whether you can govern your people
or not.</p>

<h4><i>Pe-ta-le-sha-roo</i>, Republican chief.</h4>

<p>Father, I am not afraid of these people, these Pawnees
you see here. They have never struck me with a whip;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
(meaning, that when he has chastised his people they have
not retaliated upon him.)</p>

<p>Father, I have travelled through all the nations below;
they have not injured me.</p>

<p>Father, I have seen people travel in blood. I have {295}
travelled in blood myself, but it was the blood of Red Skins,
no others.</p>

<p>Father, I have been in all the nations round about, and
I have never feared a Red Skin.</p>

<p>Father, I have seen the time when blood flowed upon
the ground. It drew tears from many eyes. But I went
down to visit my father, (Governor Clarke,) and returned
contented.</p>

<p>Father, I have no longer a desire for war. I delight to
sit in peace.</p>

<p>Father, When I went to see my father below, although
there was danger in the way, I was not afraid to go alone.</p>

<p>Father, But I am now like a squaw, and instead of
carrying the mark of a man, I have that of a woman.</p>

<p>Father, My right arm, and that half of my body is white
man, and the other only Indian.</p>

<p>Father, When I returned from below, I related to my
people what I had seen, but none of them had ears; they
would not hear me.</p>

<p>Father, I have often traded with the whites. I always
traded fairly, while the Pawnee Loups did not. Here is a
trader who knows me (Mr. Pappan).</p>

<p>Father, We will punish the offenders. It is very easy;
it is not difficult at all.</p>

<p>Father, I will score the back of him who cut your tent.</p>

<p>Father, It is some time since I have worn this on my
neck; I have kept it secreted, because they will not respect
it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span></p>

<p>Father, After our battles with the people around us, I
have gone alone, crying into their villages, and have received
no harm. (In other words, Indians have forgiven
me for spilling their blood, then why should not the magnanimity
of the whites forgive the comparative trifling injuries
I have done them.)</p>

<p>Father, When the war-party that robbed your {296} people
returned, I was not told of this act. If I had known it,
and had demanded the articles, perhaps they would have
been given up to me; but they are now so widely distributed
that it is impossible to collect them all.</p>

<p>Father, I have never yet whipped my people, but I intend
to begin now. I will punish the offenders as soon as
I return home.</p>

<p>Father, I am glad to see you writing down all that has
been said. When a man dies, his actions are forgotten,
but when they are written down, it is not so.</p>

<p>Father, Some among us have had difficulty with the
traders, because they would give but very little vermilion,
&amp;c. for our furs.</p>

<p>Father, When I have seen a person poor, and I had a
horse to spare, or a blanket, I have given it to him.</p>

<p>Father, From this day I undergo a change; I am now
an American, and you shall hear that it is true.</p>

<p>Father, If you hear of my being whipped when I return
to my village, consider yourself the cause of it, for I will
whip those dogs that insulted you as you desire me.</p>

<p>Father, You love your children; I love mine.</p>

<p>Father, Be quick, do what you have to do. If you intend
to punish us, let us know it.</p>

<p>(This is an artful, politic Indian. If he is sincere in
what he has here said, his change has been a sudden one.
When Mr. Dougherty delivered the talk sent by Major
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
O'Fallon to this people, in their village, demanding the
stolen articles, &amp;c. this man ridiculed him, saying, that for
his part he had nothing but an old pair of shoes that the
Red Head had given him, and which he would return.)</p>

<h4>{297} <i>Major O'Fallon</i></h4>

<p>Do you wish to see our warriors among you, to punish
these people. I do not wish to see them among you.
You, chief of the Pawnee Republicans, (addressing the
last speaker,) you say you are able to punish them; I am
in hopes that you have not lied; if you have, we must do
it ourselves. If my eyes cannot see you punish them, my
ears must tell me you have done it.—Yes! my ears must tell
me it has been well done, that you have given two stripes
for every one that those two unfortunate traders have suffered.
And you, Long Hair, that have so strong an arm,
assist him, lest our warriors should be obliged to visit you,
when yourself might not be distinguished from the others.
I do not yet know you as chiefs, but I wish to know you as
such; I want to have some proofs that you are chiefs.
When I learn that you have punished those who have done
wrong, as our chiefs punish, then I will recognize you.
You tell me that your stomachs are empty: I will give you
something to fill them. You show me your naked skin;
my heart will not let me clothe it until this difference is
settled. Were I to smoke with you on this day, the smoke
would not rise; it would fall to the ground. When I shall
be able to cover what is past, and to forget it; when I
smile upon you in shaking hands, then perhaps I may
give you something to eat and to smoke. I come not to
beg your friendship; I come not to ask your land or your
skins; I ask nothing of you. Pawnees! I wish to be at
peace with you, and all the Red Skins, I tell you again. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
know that the Great Spirit has done little for you; he has
done much for us. I come to do something for you, when
I see you willing to do something for yourselves. I come
to give you advice to enable you to live happily, to calm
your troubled minds, and to give peace to your troubled
heads.</p>

<p>{298} If in reality you punish those who have offended,
and my ears tell me so, I will take you by the hand and
smoke with you; but if your ears are unwilling to hear my
words, close your ears and do not hear them.</p>

<p>I will work a change among you, Red Skins, and when
my arm fails, my bones shall whiten on your plains, for
my nation to come and bury.</p>

<p><i>Pawnee Loups</i>, Before you leave this place I will give
you something to make your hearts glad.</p>

<p><i>Long Hair</i>, If you would make me believe that you are
disposed to behave well, treat those good people (the Pawnee
Loups) that reside with you kindly. Your arm is
stronger than theirs; do not raise it against them, unless
they insult you. I hope the day is not far distant, when
I shall be able to smile on your people, as I now smile on
them.</p>

<p><i>Pawnees</i>, When you find yourselves unable to punish
those dogs among you, think that you hear the sound of
those bugles from the hills near your village.</p>

<h4>(Presents were now made to the Pawnee Loups; but to
the others only a little tobacco was given, and no chiefs
were recognized.)</h4>

 The allusion is indefinite. In the reign of Augustus a law was enacted
under which conviction for this offense was liable to be followed by confiscation
and banishment; as habitual prostitution was not so punished, Roman matrons
often chose public shame to avoid the penalties of the law. A law of Justinian
made the adultery of a wife punishable by whipping and confinement in a convent
during life, unless the husband remitted the confinement within two years.

 This custom is the same with that of the ancient Jews under the law of

brother shall take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother." And Elphinstone,

 Humboldt observes of the natives of New Spain, that "their head never
becomes gray. It is infinitely more rare to find an Indian than a negro with
gray hairs; and the want of a beard gives the former a continual air of youth.
The skin of Indians is also less subject to wrinkles." In this latter character,
at least, it will be perceived, that our observations on the Missouri Indians do
not coincide with those of the Baron, respecting the natives he describes. Ulloa
informs us, that the symptoms of old age are a beard and gray hairs. But the
natives of the region of the Missouri have certainly no greater density of beard,
when advanced in age, than during their earlier years, though it is equally
certain, that owing to a neglect of personal neatness, their beard is suffered to
grow; yet, agreeably to our opportunities of judging, its ordinary character of
sparse distribution is never changed.—<span class="smcap">James.</span></p>

<p><i>Comment by Ed.</i> Catlin notes the common occurrence of gray hair among
the Mandan as a peculiarity of that people; see Smithsonian <i>Report</i>, 1885,

 The tribe here mentioned belonged to the Siouan family, and its numbers
were estimated by Lewis and Clark at two thousand five hundred. Their chief
village was situated on Knife River, North Dakota. Minitaree means "to cross
water;" Grosventres is French for "Big Bellies." The proper name of this
tribe is Hidatsa, which distinguishes it from an unrelated tribe farther west,
to which both of the former appellations are sometimes applied—generally
with the addition "of the Prairie;" the Hidatsa being known as Grosventres
(or Minitaree) "of the Missouri." Their numbers were thinned by an epidemic
in 1837, and in 1845 they removed some sixty miles farther up the Missouri,
where they were joined by the Mandan, and later (1862) by the Arikara. About
four hundred and fifty Hidatsa now live on the Fort Berthold Reservation,
in North Dakota.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

 The gravity of the Indian is almost proverbial: he will smile, but he
rarely laughs. He does not indulge in badinage, or unnecessary remarks respecting
the weather, merely for the purpose of talking, and generally addresses
his companions in a low voice, and with few words, excepting in council, when
his elocution is loud, rapid, and vehement: the voice is full, harsh, and somewhat

 John R. Bell was a New Yorker, who was graduated from West Point in
1812, and served in the light artillery through the War of 1812-15. For a short
time prior to his departure for the Missouri, he was commandant of cadets
and instructor in infantry tactics at West Point. Afterwards he was in garrison
at Savannah and Fort Moultrie; breveted major in 1824, he died the
succeeding year.</p>

<p>For sketch of Edwin James, the compiler of this account of the expedition,

<p>The secretary of the navy at this time was Smith Thompson, of New York
(1768-1843). He succeeded George Crowinshield, of Massachusetts, in this
office (1818), and held the post until 1823. Previous to his appointment he
had been on the supreme bench of New York (since 1802), and had become
chief justice (1814). In 1823 he was made associate justice on the federal
bench.</p>

<p>John Torrey (1796-1873), one of America's greatest botanists, was the son
of a New York Revolutionary officer. Entering the army as a surgeon in 1824,
he taught the sciences at West Point until 1828; from that time until 1855 he
was connected, as professor of chemistry and botany, with Princeton College,
the University of the City of New York, and the College of Physicians and
Surgeons in New York City. He was one of the founders (1817) of the New
York Lyceum of Natural History, which became the New York Academy of
Sciences, and was the preceptor and lifelong associate of Asa Gray, with whom
he also collaborated. Of especial interest to readers of the present volumes is
the fact that Dr. Torrey undertook the examination of the botanical collections
made on Long's expedition. He also examined the collections made by several
later exploring parties, notably those of Fr&eacute;mont to the Rocky Mountains (1845)
and California (1853).</p>

<p>John Eatton Le Conte (1784-1860) was descended from a Huguenot family
which settled at New Rochelle, New York, about the close of the seventeenth
century. He served in the corps of topographical engineers from 1818 to 1831,
gaining the brevet rank of major. Known as the author of special botanical
and zoological studies, he was also a member of the New York Lyceum of
Natural History, and vice-president of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural
Sciences.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

 Genus <i>Pseudostoma</i>.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> <span class="smcap">Say.</span>—Cheek-pouches exterior to the mouth;
incisores naked, truncated; molares sixteen, destitute of radicles; crown simple,
oval; anterior ones double.</p>

<p>Species, <i>Pseudostoma bursaria</i>.—Body sub-cylindrical, covered with reddish-brown
hair, which is plumbeous at base; feet white, anterior nails elongated,
posterior ones short, and concave beneath.</p>

<p><i>Mus bursarius</i>, (Shaw, Trans. Lin. Soc. Lond. and Genl. Zoology.)—<i>Body</i>
elongated, sub-cylindrical; <i>hair</i> reddish-brown, plumbeous at base; <i>beneath</i>
rather paler; <i>cheek-pouches</i> capacious, covered with hair both within and without;
<i>vibriss&aelig;</i> numerous, slender, whitish; <i>eyes</i> black; <i>ears</i> hardly prominent;
<i>feet</i> five-toed, white, anterior pair robust, with large, elongated, somewhat compressed
nails, exposing the bone on the inner side, middle nail much longest,
then the fourth, then the second, then the fifth, the first being very short; posterior
feet slender, nails concave beneath, rounded at tip, the exterior one very
small; <i>tail</i> short, hairy at base, nearly naked towards the tip.</p>

<p>This animal is congeneric with the Tucan of Hernandez, which Buffon
erroneously considers the same as the <i>Talpha rubra Americana</i> of Seba, or
<i>Talpha rubra</i>, Lin., an animal which is, however, entirely out of the question,
and which, if we may be allowed to judge from Seba's figure, is so far from
having any specific affinity with the <i>bursarius</i>, that it cannot now be regarded
as co-ordinate with it.</p>

<p>The late professor B. S. Barton, in his Medical and Physical Journal, says,
that a species of <i>Mus</i> allied to the <i>M. bursarius</i> of Shaw, is common in Georgia
and Florida; that he examined a living specimen of this animal, and was convinced
that it is no other than the Tucan of Hernandez, and the Tuza or Tozan
of Clavigero. He says nothing of its size; but on the same page he remarks,
"that another species of Mus, much larger [than] the Tuza, inhabits west of
the Mississippi about latitude 30&deg;, of which very little is known." Dr. Barton
was aware that the cheek pouches, in the figures given by Shaw, are represented
in an inverted position, but not having seen specimens from the trans-Mississippi
country, he was unacquainted with their specific identity with those of Canada,
from which those figures were drawn. In our zoological reports to Major
Long, in the year 1819, the specimens which we found on the Missouri were
recorded under the name of <i>bursarius</i> of Shaw. Coxe, in his description of
"Carolana called Florida, and of the Meschacebe," 1741, mentions a "rat with
a bag under its throat, wherein it conveys its young when forced to fly."</p>

<p>Several other writers have noticed these animals, of whom Dr. Mitchell,
in Silliman's Journal, 1821, mentions the identity of specimens obtained beyond
Lake Superior, with the M. <i>bursarius</i> of Shaw.</p>

<p>The animals belonging to this genus are distinguished by their voluminous
cheek-pouches, which are perfectly exterior to the mouth, from which they are
separated by the common integument, they are profoundly concave, opening
downwards, and towards the mouth.</p>

<p>The <i>incisores</i> which are not covered by the lips, but are always exposed to
view, are strong and truncated in their entire width at tip; the superior ones
are each marked by a deep, longitudinal groove near the middle, and by a
smaller one at the inner margin. The <i>molares</i>, to the number of eight in each
jaw, penetrate to the base of their respective alveoles, without any division into
roots, as in the genus <i>Arvicola</i>, <i>Lepus</i>, &amp;c., their crown is simply discoidal,
transversely oblong oval, margined by the enamel, and in general form they
resemble the teeth of a <i>Lepus</i>, but without the appearance either of a groove
at their ends, or of a dividing crest of enamel; the posterior tooth is rather more
rounded than the others, and that of the upper-jaw has a small prominent angle
on its posterior face; the anterior tooth is double, in consequence of a profound
duplicature in its side, so that its crown presents two oval disks, of which the
anterior one is smaller, and in the lower jaw somewhat angulated. All the
molares of the lower jaw incline obliquely forward, and those of the superior
jaw obliquely backward.</p>

<p>The whole animal has a clumsy aspect, having a large head and body, with
short legs, large fore feet, and small hind feet; and although it walks awkwardly,
yet it burrows with the greatest rapidity, so that the difficulty of obtaining specimens
may be, in a great degree, attributed to the facility with which the animal
passes through the soil, in removing from the vicinity of danger.</p>

<p>They cast up mounds of loose earth, which, like those of the <i>blind rat</i>,
(Spalax typhlus) have no exterior opening. These elevations have been aptly
compared, by Lewis and Clarke, to such heaps of earth as would be formed by
the emptying of the loose contents of a flower-pot upon the soil. The mounds
are of various dimensions, from the diameter of a few inches only, to that of
several yards; the quantity of earth employed consequently varies from a
pint to two or three bushels.</p>

<p>So entirely subterranean is the life of this animal, that it is rarely seen; and
many persons have lived for many years surrounded by their little edifices,
without knowing the singular being by whose labours they are produced.</p>

<p>It is known by the names of <i>sand-rat</i>, <i>goffer</i>, <i>pouched-rat</i>, <i>salamander</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>—<span class="smcap">James.</span></p></div>

autumn of 1815 he settled at the place called Loutre Lick, on the site of the
present village of Mineola, Montgomery County, and a considerable immigration
followed. A man named Massey had attempted a settlement even earlier,

deposits. Mine la Motte was settled as early as 1722; its site is about four miles
north of Fredericktown. St. Michael was settled in 1801, by immigrants from
North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia, and in 1822 contained
fifty dwellings; then it declined and almost disappeared. Its site is on the north
bank of Saline Creek, opposite Fredericktown.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

 Thrall's settlement was about four miles north of Rocheport, Boone
County. The first settlers arrived as early as 1812, and after the War of 1812-15
the population grew rapidly. Augustus Thrall, for whom the place was named,
came in 1816. The site was on land granted by the federal government to
sufferers from the New Madrid earthquake.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

 The text does not make clear the route of the party through Carroll County,
especially as Doe Creek cannot be identified. If this stream was a tributary
of Grand River, the party could not have crossed a branch of the Wahconda in
a course north, 45&deg; west; for Big Creek, a tributary of the Grand, which flows
southeasterly through the eastern half of the county, would have separated
them from the Wahconda basin. It seems likely that they ascended the watershed
between Big Creek and the Wahconda, and that Doe Creek was a small
branch of the former. The two tributaries of the Grand which were crossed
may have been Big Creek and one of its large branches, probably the Little
Wahconda, which flows south through the centre of the county. The journey
of twenty-two miles must have brought them near the northern line of Carroll
County.</p>

<p>Wahconda (sometimes Wakanda and Wakenda) is, as the text has explained,
the Indian name for the supreme being (Master of Life). The stream pursues
an eastward course across Carroll County. Its waters abounded in fish and its
banks in game; to the Indians such abundance seemed to betoken the presence
of the deity, and the stream was regarded as sacred. Another legend concerning
the name is, that two Sioux died while passing a night upon its bank,
and as they bore no marks of violence, the Indians attributed their death to
the Master of Life.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

 A. F. Baronet Vasquez accompanied Pike as interpreter. He was the
fifth child of Benito Vasquez, a Spaniard, who came to St. Louis in 1770, at
the age of twenty, in the capacity of a subordinate military officer. His mother,
Julia Papin, was a French Canadian, daughter of Pierre Papin. Baronet
Vasquez, born in 1783, was in 1808 appointed ensign in the United States army;
he left the service in 1814, at which time he was a first lieutenant of infantry.

 Bernard Pratte was engaged in the fur-trade for many years, yet available
information concerning him is scanty. When Astor retired from the American
Fur Company (1834), the business of its Western Department was sold to the
St. Louis firm of Pratte, Chouteau and Co. Pratte withdrew in 1838, but in
1842 reappeared as the head of the rival firm of Pratte, Cabanne and Co. In
1819, Pratte and Vasquez had a post above Council Bluffs, perhaps nearly
opposite the site of the present town of Onawa, Iowa. See Chittenden, <i>American
Fur Trade</i>, pp. 364, 366, 367, 951. The Vasquez associated with Pratte
was a brother of "Baroney," probably Benito, Jr.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

 Sylvanus Fancher (called "Doctor" by courtesy) was a native of Plymouth,
Connecticut. An eccentric, uneducated character, his notoriety was due
to the fact that he embraced the vaccine theory before it was adopted by
regular physicians. His operations in the unoccupied field of New England
were for a few years remunerative; but his improvidence prevented the accumulation
of a competence, and as medical men took up the practice of vaccination,
his means of livelihood declined. He died in Hartford in abject poverty. See

 The first creek west of Beaver is Plum, so called from the abundance of
wild plums growing on its banks; it is not shown on most maps. The name
Creek of Souls is prophetic, as a mission station was established here in 1843.
Next to Plum Creek was Council Creek, flowing south through Boone and Nance
counties. Its name commemorates an Indian council held there some years
later by Dougherty. The names of Plum Creek and Council Creek are sometimes
interchanged. Beyond Council Creek is Cedar Creek (see <i>ante</i>, note 43).</p>

<p>The Grand Pawnee village stood about thirty miles above the mouth of

 <i>Arctomys Ludoviciana.</i> <span class="smcap">Ord.</span>—This interesting and sprightly little
animal has received the absurd and inappropriate name of Prairie dog, from a
fancied resemblance of its warning cry to the hurried barking of a small dog.
This sound may be imitated with the human voice, by the pronunciation of the
syllable cheh, cheh, cheh, in a sibilated manner, and in rapid succession, by
propelling the breath between the tip of the tongue and the roof of the mouth.
The animal is of a light dirty reddish-brown colour above, which is intermixed
with some gray, also a few black hairs. This coating of hair is of a dark lead
colour next the skin, then bluish-white, then light reddish, then gray at the tip.
The lower parts of the body are of a dirty white colour. The head is wide and
depressed above, with large eyes; the iris is dark brown. The ears are short
and truncated; the whiskers of moderate length and black; a few bristles project
from the anterior portion of the superior orbit of the eye, and a few also from a
wart on the cheek: the nose is somewhat sharp and compressed; the hair of the
anterior legs, and that of the throat and neck, is not dusky at base. All the
feet are five-toed, covered with very short hair, and armed with rather long
black nails: the exterior one of the fore foot nearly attains the base of the next,
and the middle one is half an inch in length: the thumb is armed with a conic
nail, three-tenths of an inch in length; the tail is rather short, banded with
brown near the tip, and the hair, excepting near the body, is not plumbeous at
base.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>The length of the animal, from the tip of the nose to the origin of the tail,
is sixteen inches; of the tail, two inches and three-fourths; of the hair at its
tip three-fourths of an inch.</p>

<p>As particular districts, of limited extent, are, in general, occupied by the
burrows of these animals, such assemblages of dwellings are denominated
<i>Prairie dog villages</i> by hunters and others who wander in these remote regions.</p>

<p>These villages, like those of man, differ widely in the extent of surface which
they occupy; some are confined to an area of a few acres, others are bounded
by a circumference of many miles. Only one of these villages occurred between
the Missouri and the Pawnee towns; thence to the Platte they were much more
numerous.</p>

<p>The entrance to the burrow is at the summit of the little mound of earth,
brought up by the animal during the progress of the excavation below.</p>

<p>These mounds are sometimes inconspicuous, but generally somewhat
elevated above the common surface, though rarely to the height of eighteen
inches. Their form is that of a truncated cone, on a base of two or three feet,
perforated by a comparatively large hole or entrance at the summit or in the
side. The whole surface, but more particularly the summit, is trodden down
and compacted, like a well-worn pathway. The hole descends vertically to
the depth of one or two feet, whence it continues in an oblique direction downward.</p>

<p>A single burrow may have many occupants. We have seen as many as
seven or eight individuals sitting upon one mound.</p>

<p>They delight to sport about the entrance of their burrows in pleasant weather;
at the approach of danger they retreat to their dens; or when its proximity is
not too immediate, they remain, barking, and flourishing their tails, on the
edge of their holes, or sitting erect to reconnoitre. When fired upon in this
situation, they never fail to escape, or if killed, instantly to fall into their burrows,
where they are beyond the reach of the hunter.</p>

<p>As they pass the winter in a lethargic sleep, they lay up no provision of food
for that season, but defend themselves from its rigours by accurately closing up
the entrance of the burrow. The further arrangements which the Prairie dog
makes for its comfort and security are well worthy of attention. He constructs
for himself a very neat globular cell with fine dry grass, having an aperture at
top, large enough to admit the finger, and so compactly formed that it might
almost be rolled over the floor without receiving injury.</p>

<p>The burrows are not always equidistant from each other, though they occur
usually at intervals of about twenty feet.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>—<span class="smcap">James.</span></p>

 In these villages, where the grass is fed close, and where much fresh earth is
brought up and exposed to the air, is the peculiar habitat of a species of Solanum
approaching the <i>S. triflorum</i> of Nuttall, which, he says, occurs as a weed "about the
gardens of the Mandans and Minatarees of the Missouri, and in no other situations."
It appears to differ from the S. triflorum in being a little hirsute, with flat, runcinate,
pinnatifid leaves, and the peduncles alternating with the leaves. The Solanum <i>heterandrum</i>
of Pursh, now referred to the new genus Androcera of Nuttall, is also very common,
but is not confined, like the plant just mentioned, to the marmot villages. We
collected also the Psoralea <i>cuspidata</i>, Ph. P. <i>esculenta</i>, N. P. <i>incana</i>, N. also a species of
Hieracium—H. <i>runcinatum</i>. Plant hirsute, leaves all radical, elliptic-oblong, runcinate;
scape few-flowered, somewhat compressed, and angular; glands on the hairs of the

 In rain water puddles, we remarked a new species of Branchiopode belonging
to the genus Apus; small crustaceous animals, which exhibit a miniature
resemblance to the King or Horse-shoe Crab, (Himulus polyphemus,) of our
sea coast, but which are furnished with about sixty pairs of feet, and swim upon
their back. The basins of water, which contained them, had been very much diminished
by evaporation and infiltration, and were now crowded to excess, principally
with the apus, great numbers of which were dying upon the surrounding
mud, whence the water had receded. This species is distinguished from the <i>productus</i>
of Bosc, and <i>montagui</i> of Leach, by not having the dorsal carina prolonged
in a point behind; and from <i>cancriformis</i>, by the greater proportional width of the
thorax, and more obtuse emargination behind. The length of the thorax along
the middle, is three-tenths of an inch, and its greatest breadth somewhat more.

 <i>Castor fiber.</i>—Some of the European naturalists appear to be in doubt,
whether or not the beavers of Europe are of the same species with ours, from the
circumstance of the former not erecting habitations for themselves, thus appearing
to differ at least in habit, from the North American, (which are usually but
improperly called, Canada beaver, as they are not confined to Canada, but are
found far south in the United States, and east to the confluence of the Ohio and
Mississippi,) but it is possible, that the aboriginal manners of the European
beavers, corresponded with those of ours, and that necessity, resulting from the
population of the country by civilized man, compelled them to resort to a different
mode of life, to escape the certain destruction, with which the great demand for
their fur threatened them. But as the European beaver is smaller than ours,
other naturalists have regarded it as a distinct species. In those districts of
country of North America, from which they have not yet been exterminated,
and which are populated by the whites, as particularly on the Mississippi, above
the Ohio, and below St. Louis, we have not heard that they build, but it is more
than probable, that, as in Europe, they change their mode of life, in order to be
the more effectually concealed from view. From subsequent observation, we
have learned, that the beaver does not attempt to dam large streams, perceiving
at once the impracticability of the undertaking: his object in damming a stream
appears to be, to preserve a constancy in the height of the water, in order that
the entrance to his habitation in the bank may be concealed, and that the curious
conical edifice may not be destroyed by a sudden flood, or too much exposed by
a deficiency of water.</p>

<p>An Indian informed us, that in his time, he has caught three specimens of
this animal, that had each a large white spot on the breast. Singular accounts
of this animal are given us by the hunters, but which we had no opportunity of
verifying.</p>

<p>Three beavers were seen cutting down a large cotton-wood tree; when they
had made considerable progress, one of them retired to a short distance, and took
his station in the water, looking steadfastly at the top of the tree. As soon as he
perceived the top begin to move towards its fall, he gave notice of the danger to
his companions, who were still at work, gnawing at its base, by slapping his tail
upon the surface of the water, and they immediately ran from the tree out of
harm's way.</p>

<p>The spring beaver are much better for commerce than those of the autumn
and early winter, as the fur is longer and more dense. But the beaver taken in
the vicinity of the Rocky Mountains is almost equally good during the year.</p>

<p>Mr. Frazer, a gentleman who has been several years engaged in the fur trade,
in the interior of North America, on the Columbia, and in North California, in
speaking of the beaver, mentioned a circumstance, which we do not remember
to have seen recorded. The lodges are usually so placed, that the animals ascend
the stream some distance to arrive at the spot whence they procure their food.
They make their excursions under water, and they have, at equal distances,
excavations under the bank, called <i>washes</i>, into which they go and raise their
heads above the surface, in order to breathe, without exposing themselves to be

the ground returns when beaten; and the beavers are sometimes taken, by being
pursued into these holes, the entrances to which are afterwards closed.</p>

<p>Otters are frequent on the Missouri. We had an opportunity of seeing on the
ice of Boyer Creek a considerable number of the tracks or paths of otters; they
were the more readily distinguishable, from there being snow of but little depth
on the ice, and they appeared as if the animal was accustomed to slide in his
movements on the ice, as there were, in the first place, the impressions of two
feet, then a long mark clear of snow a distance of three or four feet, then the
impressions of the feet of the animal, after which the sliding mark, and so on
alternately. These paths were numerous, and passed between the bank and a
situation, where a hole had been in the ice, now frozen over.—<span class="smcap">James.</span></p></div>

 Andrew Henry was born in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, between 1773
and 1778, and died in Washington County, Missouri, in 1832. He was one of
the original incorporators of the Missouri Fur Company in 1809 and the next
year built the first post established by an American trader beyond the crest of
the Rockies; this was Fort Henry, on Snake River, probably near the present
village of Egin, Fremont County, Idaho. It was abandoned the succeeding
spring, but furnished shelter for a few days to the party under Hunt, bound
overland to Astoria. (See Bradbury's <i>Travels</i>, in our volume v, note 2). Little
is known of Henry from 1811 to 1822; at the latter date he entered into partnership
with General W. H. Ashley (congressman from Missouri, 1831-37), and for
a time prospered in the fur-trade, but lost his fortune by becoming a surety for
others.</p>

 There is a considerable error in the longitude of points in western Nebraska
and Colorado as given on the map of the expedition. For example, the longitude
of the town of North Platte, at the confluence of the forks of the Platte, is 100&deg;
45' 53"; while on the accompanying map the one hundred and second meridian
runs but little west of the spot. For this reason, and because of the few landmarks
described, the location of the camps of the expedition can only be approximated;
but that of June 26 must have been quite near the Nebraska-Colorado
boundary. The South Platte leaves Colorado almost exactly at the northeastern

 The name "Black Hills," which is now associated with the mountains
of southwestern South Dakota, has also been applied somewhat indefinitely to
hills in Nebraska, Wyoming, and Colorado. Lewis and Clark's map places
hills so named along the eastern side of the North Platte, running well into Nebraska.
The name is sometimes given to the hills enclosed by the circular
course of the North Platte, in southeastern Wyoming; while Fr&eacute;mont (1842)
applies it to the hills through which Cache la Poudre River cuts its way to the

live in our houses as they do, we should be poisoned with our own nastiness;

 A small fox was killed, which appears to be the animal mentioned by
Lewis and Clarke, in the account of their travels, under the name of the <i>burrowing
fox</i>, (vol. ii. p. 351.) It is very much to be regretted, that although two
or three specimens of it were killed by our party, whilst we were within about
two hundred miles of the mountains, yet from the dominion of peculiar circumstances,
we were unable to preserve a single entire skin; and as the description
of the animal taken on the spot was lost, we shall endeavour to make the species
known to naturalists, with the aid of only a head and a small portion of the neck
of one individual, and a cranium of another, which are now before us.</p>

<p>In magnitude, the animal is hardly more than half the size of the American
red fox, (<i>Canis Virginianus</i>, of the recent authors,) to which it has a considerable
resemblance. But, that it is an adult, and not the young of that species, the presence
of the large carnivorous tooth, and the two posterior molar teeth of the
lower jaw, on each side, sufficiently attest; these teeth, as well as all the others,
being very much worn down, prove that the milk teeth have been long since shed.</p>

<p>The teeth, in form, correspond to considerable exactness with those of our
red fox; but the anterior three and four false molares of both these species are
sufficiently distinguished from the corresponding teeth of the gray, or tri-coloured
fox (C. cinereo-argenteus) by being wider at base, and less elongated perpendicularly,
and by having the posterior basal lobe of each, longer and much more
distinctly armed with a tubercle at tip.</p>

<p>Besides this disparity of dentition in the red and gray foxes, the general form
of the cranium, and its particular detailed characters, as a less elevated occipital,
and temporal crest, more profoundly sinuous junction of the malar with the
maxillary bone, the absence of elevated lines bounding the space between the
insertions of the lateral muscles, passing in a slightly reclivate direction between
the orbital processes, and the anterior tip of the occipital crest, and in particular
the want of an angular process of the lower jaw beneath the spinous process in
the cranium of the red fox, are sufficiently obvious characters to indicate even
by this portion of the osseous structure alone, its specific distinctness from the
gray fox. In these differences the osteology of the burrowing fox equally participates,
and although besides these characters in common with the red fox,
we may observe a correspondence in many other respects, yet there are also many
distinctions which the cranium of this small species will present, when more
critically compared with that well known animal, which unequivocally forbid us
from admitting their identity. The common elevated space on the parietal bones
between the insertions of the lateral muscles is one-fourth wider, and extends
further backward, so as to embrace a notable portion of the anterior angle of
the sagitto-occipital crest; the recipient cavity in the inferior jaw for the attachment
of the masseter muscle is more profound, and the coronoid process,
less elevated than the top of the zygomatic arch, is more obtusely rounded at
tip than that of the red fox.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the cranium, as taken by the calipers:</p>

<p>The entire length from the insertion of the superior incisores to the tip of the
occipital crest, is rather more than four inches and three-tenths. The least distance
between the orbital cavities, nine-tenths. Between the tips of the orbital
processes less than one inch and one-tenth. Between the insertions of the lateral
muscles, at the junction of the frontal and parietal bones, half an inch. Greatest
breadth of this space on the parietal bones thirteen-twentieths of an inch.</p>

<p>The hair is fine, dense, and soft. The head above is fulvous, drawing on
ferruginous, intermixed with gray, the fur being of the first-mentioned colour,
and the hair whitish at base; then black; then gray; then brown. The ridge
of the nose is somewhat paler, and a more brownish dilated line passes from
the eye to near the nostrils, (as in the C. corsac). The margin of the upper lip
is white; the orbits are gray; the ears behind are paler than the top of the head,
intermixed with black hairs and the margin, excepting at tip, white; the inner
side is broadly margined with white hairs; the space behind the ear is destitute
of the intermixture of hairs; the neck above has longer hairs, of which the black
and gray portions are more conspicuous; beneath the head pure white.</p>

<p>The body is slender, and the tail rather long, cylindrical, and black.</p>

<p>It runs with extraordinary swiftness, so much so, that when at full speed,
its course has been by the hunters compared to the flight of a bird skimming the
surface of the earth. We had opportunities of seeing it run with the antelope;
and appearances sanctioned the belief, that in fleetness it even exceeded that
extraordinary animal, famed for swiftness, and for the singularity of its horns.
Like the corsac of Asia it burrows in the earth, in a country totally destitute of
trees or bushes, and is not known to dwell in forest districts.</p>

<p>If Buffon's figure of the corsac is to be implicitly relied upon, our burrowing
fox must be considered as perfectly distinct, and anonymous; we would, therefore,
propose for it the name of <i>velox</i>.—<span class="smcap">James.</span></p></div>

 Rays of light, falling with any degree of obliquity upon the particles of that
portion of watery vapour which lies near the surface of the earth, may be reflected,
and pass off at an equal corresponding angle; so that if the eye be raised a few
feet above the reflecting surface, an image of the corresponding arc of the sky
is produced, as in the case of a sheet of water where the image, seen by the reflected
light, is not that of the water, but the sky. Hence any object, which

beyond the reflecting surface to that surface, is returned to the eye in a darkened

 At this point it becomes difficult to follow exactly the movements of the
party, as the nomenclature of the region has in the interim changed almost entirely.
Moreover, the itinerary is carelessly recorded and the map of the expedition
is inaccurate. The journey of twenty-seven miles on July 1, reckoned
from the camp of June 30, near the Bijeau, as shown on the map, brought the
party nearly to the Cache la Poudre River, which flows from the northwest,
reaching the South Platte below the bend where its course turns eastward.
Cache la Poudre is shown but not named on the map, which, apparently erring,
places the camp of July 1 and 2 above its mouth; for it is evidently the first of
the large creeks passed on the third. At the bend is Thompson Creek, also
unnamed on Long's map; and just above is St. Vrain Creek. Both of these flow
from the west and the latter evidently corresponds to Potera's Creek of the text.
The bend in the river, passed July 3, is the point of nearest approach to Long's
Peak, still forty miles distant. Near the camp of that evening, at the mouth of
St. Vrain's Creek, the important fur-trading firm of Bent and St. Vrain built
St. Vrain's Fort about twenty years later. In favorable weather, Pike's Peak
is visible from this point.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

robust than the three anterior pairs of feet, of subequal diameter, but rather
thicker towards the tip; more hairy than the feet; <i>eyes</i> and <i>tubercle</i> blackish;
<i>mandibles</i> dilated, with numerous rigid set&aelig;, and with parallel set&aelig; projected
over the fingers; <i>fingers</i> regularly arquated, reddish-brown at tip, and with a

<p>2. G. <i>subulata</i>, <span class="smcap">Say</span>.—Hairy; <i>mandibles</i> horizontal; <i>thumb</i> nearly rectilinear,
destitute of teeth. This species has the strongest resemblance to the preceding,
both in form, magnitude, and colouring; but the superior finger of the mandibles
is unarmed, and rectilinear or very slightly flexuous; the inferior finger
is arquated, with about two robust teeth.—<span class="smcap">James.</span></p></div>

 The North Fork of the South Platte encloses South Park on the north,
flowing from west to east; while the other branch, which retains the name South
Platte, encircles South Park on the south and east. The Denver, Leadville, and
Gunnison Railroad now enters the mountain district through Platte Ca&ntilde;on.
It is probable that Pike entered South Park in 1806 (see volume xvi, note 14); but
Long's failure to penetrate the mountains at this point left the famous park
unknown, save to wandering hunters, until Fr&eacute;mont's time, more than twenty
years later.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

 Among many plants collected in this excursion, some of them new to us,
we recognized an old acquaintance in the bearberry (Arbutus <i>uva-ursi</i>, L.) an
inhabitant of the mountainous districts of New York and New England; also
the Dodecatheon <i>integrifolium</i>, Ph.; and a beautiful little plant referable to the
genus Mentzelia of Plumier. On the higher parts of the mountain an oak is
common, approaching in character to the Quercus <i>banisteri</i>, Mx. Also a small
undescribed acer, the Juniperus <i>communis</i> and I. <i>virginiana</i>; in the ravines,
the Rhus <i>toxicodendron</i>, Spir&aelig;a <i>opulifolia</i>, olc; and at the base of the mountains

 A series of erroneous dates begins here. The expedition undoubtedly left
Platte Ca&ntilde;on July 8, of which day the text gives no account. July 9 was Sunday,
instead of July 10, as the text states below. A compensating error is introduced
by giving the date July 12 to accounts of the journeys of parts of two
days. The Philadelphia edition also has the erroneous dating of the ninth,
tenth, and eleventh, but includes the remainder of the chapter under the last date,
thus failing entirely to account for the twelfth, and really including the operations
of three days (tenth, eleventh, and twelfth) under date of July 11. The itinerary
for these days is more accurately indicated on the map.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

 The route described on the next few pages is an impossible one. Chittenden
characterizes it as "wholly indefinite and unsatisfactory" (<i>American
Fur Trade</i>, p. 59). The date "July 12th," on the next page, does not appear
in the Philadelphia edition, and was apparently inserted to remedy the confusion;
it increases it, however, since the accounts of the journeys of two days
(July 10 and 11) are intermingled in the text itself. From the camp of July 8
and 9, the party might, by noon of the tenth, have arrived opposite Castle Rock,
which gives its name to the present seat of justice of Douglas County. This,
however, would not bring them to a tributary of the Arkansas; by noon of July 11
they could have reached the upper waters of Monument, a branch of Fountain
Creek, which unites with the Arkansas at Pueblo. The camp of July 10 is
probably accurately located on the map, a short distance below Castle Rock.
On the morning of the eleventh, the direction taken was almost due south, across
the watershed between the Platte and Arkansas, which at this point is almost
on the line between Douglas and El Paso counties. The map exaggerates the
length of Boiling Spring Creek (see succeeding volume, note 10), or Fountain
Creek, a branch of which (Monument Creek) they first encountered almost on
the county line. The afternoon march carried them somewhat south of the
base of Pike's Peak, necessitating the retracing of their route on the morning
of the twelfth. The route on the eleventh probably lay through the region now
famous as the Garden of the Gods.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

 A. <i>cœrulea</i>, <span class="smcap">James</span>.—Leaves twice ternate; flowers terminal, remote,
nectaries strait and very long. It inhabits shady woods of pine and spruce
within the mountains, rising sometimes to the height of three feet. In passing
from the headwaters of the branch of the Platte, called Defile creek, to those of
one of the northern tributaries of the Arkansa, we noticed some change in the
soil, and soon met with many plants we had not before seen. Several of these,
as the common juniper and the red cedar, (Juniperus <i>virginiana</i>, Ph.) the black
and hemlock-spruce, (Abies <i>nigra</i> and A. <i>canadensis</i>) the red maple (Acer
rubrum, Mx.) the hop horn-beam (Ostrya Virginica, L.) the Populus <i>tremuloides</i>,
Mx. Pinus <i>resinosa</i>, Pyrola <i>secunda</i>, Orchis <i>dilatata</i>, olc. are common to
mountainous districts in all the northern parts of the territory of the United
States; many others are here found, which require more careful and extensive
comparison with the plants of Mexico, Siberia, and other countries, than
have yet had the opportunity to make.—<span class="smcap">James.</span></p></div>

 One of these is a large and conspicuous plant of the natural family of the
<i>Crucifer&aelig;</i>, which may be referred to the new genus, Stanley of Nuttall, and distinguished
as S. <i>integrifolia</i>; stem simple, leaves entire, ovate oblong, tapering
to both ends; stem angular. Flowers in a terminal raceme, which is a little
branched below; about six inches in length; stipe of the silique, about as long
as the pedicle; flowers large yellow. The whole plant, seen at a little distance,
has a remote resemblance to Lysimachia thyrsifolia. The leaves are ⅚ inches
long, ⅔ wide, glaucous, and veined, nearly resembling those of the common cabbage,
but smoother, which they are not wholly unlike in taste. The calyx is
large, and of a brighter yellow than the other parts of the flower: it inhabits the
summits of the sandstone ridges, along the base of the mountains. The S.
<i>pinnatifida</i>, N., the original type of this genus, was found by its discoverer,
Mr. Nuttall, to act as a violent emetic. It had been eaten by several of the party
who accompanied him, as a substitute for cabbage.—<span class="smcap">James.</span></p></div>

 <i>Cucumis perennis</i>, S.—Calyx, seated upon the germ, rugose, coloured
campanulate, exterior divisions subulate.</p>

<p>Masc. Three filaments, short, closely covering the central disc. Fœm.
Style short, stigmas three bipartite.</p>

<p>Fruit. Pome large, orbicular, smooth, about four celled seeds, ovate, gibbous,
margin acute; dissepiments torn, spongy; seeds in a double order; leaves
alternate, triangularly cordate, margin undulate, tendrils axillary trichotomous;
stems numerous, procumbent, grooved; flowers nearly as large as those of Cucurbita
<i>pepo</i>; fruit round, smooth, and green, nearly sessile, resembling a small
unripe water-melon. The leaves are rough, of a glaucous green colour, bitter
and nauseous to the taste, and the whole plant emits a fœtid odour.</p>

<p>Root fusiform, very large, six feet in length, and often four inches in diameter,
descending perpendicularly into the earth. It inhabits the arid and sandy wastes,
along the base of the Rocky Mountains, from the confluence of the Arkansa, and
Boiling Spring Fork, to the sources of Red River. By means of its long and
somewhat succulent root it is peculiarly adapted to the soil it occupies, and is
found to thrive with considerable vigour in wastes whose thirsty and burning
soils bid defiance to almost every other vegetable. It flowers in July, and continues
flowering and perfecting fruit during the summer. Some plants of this
interesting species are growing in the garden of the University of Philadelphia,
from seeds brought by Major Long, but they have not yet flowered. The leaves
are thick and robust, from six to eight inches long, and four or five in width,
on foot-stalks equalling the leaves in length; they are crowded along the stems,
and usually stand erect. It does not appear that any insect or animal preys upon
the leaves or other parts of this plant. It forms, by its deep green, a striking
contrast to the general aspect of the regions it inhabits, which are exceedingly
naked and barren.</p>

<p>This plant has been mentioned by Mr. Brackenridge, from the information
of hunters, but no detailed account of it has hitherto been given. The annexed
figure is from a drawing by Mr. Peale, made of the plant in its native locality.
The petioles and the extremities of the stems are usually affected with morbid
enlargements, resembling galls. They may perhaps be caused by the irritation
of the intense reflected light and heat of the sun, in the situations where the plant
usually grows. In the gardens it has not hitherto produced these enlargements.—<span class="smcap">James.</span></p></div>

 1. <i>Fringilla psaltria</i>, <span class="smcap">Say</span>.—A very pretty little bird, was frequently seen
hopping about in the low trees or bushes, singing sweetly, somewhat in the manner
of the American gold-finch, or Hemp-bird (Fringilla tristis). The tints, and
the distribution of the colours of its plumage resemble, in a considerable degree,
those of the autumnal and less brilliant vesture of that well-known species. It
may, however, be distinguished, in addition to other differences, by the black
tip of its tail-feathers, and the white wing spot.</p>

<p>The <i>head</i> is capped with black; the <i>cheeks</i> are dusky; the <i>bill</i> yellow, with
a black tip; <i>iris</i> burnt umber; <i>neck</i> above, and half its side, <i>back</i>, and <i>rump</i>
olivaceous, more or less intermixed with dusky; <i>smaller wing coverts</i> blackish,
edged with olivaceous; <i>greater wing coverts</i> brown-black, tipped with white,
forming a narrow band; <i>primaries</i> fuscous, and, excepting the exterior one,
slightly edged with white; third, fourth, and fifth feathers white towards the base,
so as to exhibit a white spot beyond the wing coverts; <i>secondaries</i> margined with
white exteriorly towards their tips: <i>tail coverts</i> black, varied with olivaceous on
their shafts; <i>tail</i> emarginate, feathers blackish, slightly edged with dull whitish;
the three exterior ones pure white on their inner webs, excepting at base and
tip; all <i>beneath</i> yellow; <i>feet</i> pale. A specimen is deposited in the Philadelphia
Museum.</p>

<p>2. <i>Fringilla frontalis</i>, <span class="smcap">Say</span>.—Crimson-necked Finch. <i>Head</i>, <i>throat</i>, <i>neck
beneath</i>, and <i>upper portion of the breast</i> brilliant crimson, most intense near the
bill and over the eyes; <i>rump</i> and <i>tail coverts</i> paler crimson; between the bill and
the eye grey; <i>bill</i> dark horn colour, lower mandible paler; <i>vertex</i>, <i>occiput</i>, <i>neck
above</i> and <i>each side</i> brown, tinged with reddish, the feathers margined with
pale; <i>back</i> dusky brownish; <i>wings</i> and <i>tail</i> fuscous, the latter feathers edged on
the inner side with white; the <i>primaries</i> broadly margined within, towards the
base, with white, and exteriorly edged with a grayish; <i>coverts</i> and <i>tertials</i> edged
with dull grayish; <i>inferior portion of the breast</i>, the <i>belly</i>, and <i>vent</i> whitish, each
feather with a broad fuscous line.</p>

<p><i>Female</i>, dusky brown, the feathers margined each side with dull whitish;
wings fuscous, the margining and edging of the feathers not as distinct as in the
male; all <i>beneath</i>, excepting the tail and wing feathers, whitish, each feather with
a brown streak.</p>

<p>This bird is much more closely allied, both in size and colouring, to the purple
Finch (F. purpurea) than to the crimson-headed Finch (F. rosea), and may
prove to be only a variety of it, when a comparison of many individuals can be
made. The male, from which the above description is drawn out, may not be
in its ultimate state of plumage, as it seems probable that the middle of the head,
the upper part of the neck, and the back, in the perfect plumage, is more obviously
tinted with crimson than we have observed those parts to be. It differs,
however, from the <i>Purple Finch</i> in the tint of the crimson colour, which is far
more lively and brilliant, and also in having each feather of the belly, vent, and
inferior tail coverts broadly streaked with brown. We apply to it provisionally
the name of <i>F. frontalis</i>. A prepared specimen of this bird is in the Philadelphia
Museum.—<span class="smcap">James.</span></p></div>

 Having followed in general the course of Cheyenne Creek, the party must
have encamped a short distance south of the site of Colorado Springs, where the
stream flows into Fountain Creek. From this point there is a magnificent view
of Pike's Peak, which Pike himself usually called Grand Peak. His estimate
of the height was 18,581 feet; the error was due partially to his assumption of
the excessive elevation of 8,000 feet for the plain at the base. See the estimate
of Lieutenant Swift, in succeeding volume, note 11.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>
